Paul Johnson's brilliant and powerful reading of Jesus' life at once captures his transfiguring message and his historical complexity. With a superb historian's command of his subject, a masterly writer's love of language, and a believer's passion, Johnson presents a lucid and deeply moving biography of a man whose life changed the course of history. Jesus offers readers a succinct yet lively account of the man who inspired one of the world's great religions and whose lessons still guide us today.</p><p>Paul Johnson&#x2019;s many books, including <i>A History of Christianity, A History of the Jews, Modern Times, Churchill</i>, and <i>Napoleon: A Penguin Life</i>, have been hailed as masterpieces of historical analysis. He is a regular columnist for <i>Forbes</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>, and his work has also appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal</i>, and many others publications. He lives in London.Journalist-historian Johnson&#x2019;s deliberately noncontentious account of history&#x2019;s most famous man is unapologetically, uncarpingly based on the New Testament. Nearly no other sources are mentioned, and the short further reading list admits nothing by any Jesus Seminar scholar or other revisionist. Since the book is longer than all four Gospels put together, it is obviously more than a conflationary synopsis. Johnson weighs what little is said about Jesus&#x2019; childhood and youth and why no more is said; discusses Jesus&#x2019; personal affect; notes the qualities of his teaching, especially in the parables; emphasizes his reservations about the miracles he performs; and analyzes how he differentially addressed men, women, children, and the aged. Johnson outlines the &#x201c;new ten commandments&#x201d; that Jesus introduced in deed as well as word and with which he intended to prepare his followers not to change the world but to enter the kingdom of God. Lastly, Johnson inspects the Passion, the Resurrection, and their aftermath to Pentecost with intelligent faith. An all-but-unalloyed (the Catholic Johnson favors women in priesthood) gift to all believing Christians. --Ray Olson</p><h2>The Feast of Love: A Novel</h2><p><b>National Book Award Finalist </b><br><br>From "one of our most gifted writers" <i>(Chicago Tribune),</i> here is a superb new novel that delicately unearths the myriad manifestations of extraordinary love between ordinary people.<br><br> <i>The Feast of Love</i> is just that -- a sumptuous work of fiction about the thing that most distracts and delights us. In a re-imagined <i>Midsummer Night's Dream,</i> men and women speak of and desire their ideal mates; parents seek out their lost children; adult children try to come to terms with their own parents and, in some cases, find new ones.<br><br> In vignettes both comic and sexy, the owner of a coffee shop recalls the day his first wife seemed to achieve a moment of simple perfection, while she remembers the women's softball game during which she was stricken by the beauty of the shortstop. A young couple spends hours at the coffee shop fueling the idea of their fierce love. A professor of philosophy, stopping by for a cup of coffee, makes a valiant attempt to explain what he knows to be the inexplicable workings of the human heart Their voices resonate with each other -- disparate people joined by the meanderings of love -- and come together in a tapestry that depicts the most irresistible arena of life. Crafted with subtlety, grace, and power, <i>The Feast of Love</i> is a masterful novel.<br><br>"Supurb.... A near perfect book, as deep as it is broad in its humaneness, comedy and wisdom." -- <i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>Among literary cognoscenti, Charles Baxter has a well-deserved reputation as one of America's finest writers. Best known for his short stories, Baxter has also produced three novels. His fourth, <i>The Feast of Love</i>, combines the best of both genres--with a light dusting of metafiction to sweeten the dish. The book begins with Baxter himself waking from a nightmare and going for a moonlit walk through his hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan. While sitting on a park bench, he is joined by an acquaintance of 12 years--and, incidentally, one of the main characters in the novel. It is Bradley who gives Baxter the name for the novel he's currently struggling to write, and even offers himself as a character: <blockquote> You should call it <i>The Feast of Love</i>. I'm the expert on that. I should write that book. Actually, I should be <i>in</i> that book. You should put me into your novel. I'm an expert on love. I've just broken up with my second wife, after all. I'm in an emotional tangle. Maybe I'd shoot myself before the final chapter. Your readers would wonder about the outcome. </blockquote> But why stop there? Bradley goes on to suggest that he send people to Baxter, "actual <i>people</i>, for a change, like for instance human beings who genuinely exist, and you listen to them for a while. Everybody's got a story, and we'll just start telling you the stories we have"--a sly tip-off to the reader of this elegant, quirky, and wholly engrossing novel that the writer may be no more reliable than his narrators. <p> What follows is a chronicle of love--the mad kind, the bad kind, and the kind that sustains us when everything else is gone. In addition to Smith, we meet Chlo�, a young waitress at Bradley's espresso bar, and her ex-junkie boyfriend, Oscar; Bradley's next door neighbors, Harry Ginsburg, an elderly professor of philosophy, and his wife, Esther; and Kathryn and Diana, Bradley's two ex-wives. The characters take turns narrating, often commenting on and correcting versions of events mentioned by other characters in previous chapters, and occasionally advising Baxter on the progress of his novel: "Don't threaten people, especially lawyers" legal eagle Diana warns "Charlie" shortly before she launches into her own story. "Don't threaten your own characters. It's for your own good. You'll wind up in a mess of litigation and... <i>subplots.</i>" But in <i>The Feast of Love</i>, God is in the subplots--Oscar and Chlo�'s involvement in the porn industry; Esther and Harry's agonized relationship with their mentally ill son; Bradley's travails in love, art, and dog ownership. As the novel progresses, these separate strands gradually merge, and not even an unexpected tragedy can dim the luster of this moonstruck romance. For by the time Baxter brings his tale of love and loss and redemption to a close, his characters have all found their way to the feast--bittersweet though some of the dishes may be. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"Extraordinary. . . <b>The Feast of Love</b> is as precise, as empathetic, as luminous as any of Baxter's past work. It is also rich, juicy, laugh-out-loud funny and completely engrossing. . . . As loose and supple as life itself." <br>-- <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><p>"I had scarcely read twenty pages of Charles Baxter's superb new novel--a near perfect book, as deep as it is broad in its humaneness, comedy and wisdom--when I began to worry I couldn't do it justice in a review. . . . If there is any justice, this new novel will win him the wider fame and readership he deserves." <br>-- <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br></p><p>"The best book I've read this year. . . A beautiful, sly, bawdly and wondrous conversation on love, on mistaken pairings and the happiness when they are set aright."<br>-- <i>Detroit Free Press</i><br></p><p>"Never have I read a novel and wanted, immediately, to reread it, as I did with <b>The Feast of Love</b>. Emotionally, intellectually, in all the ways that the very best literature attends us, Charles Baxter's brilliant symphony of love, loss, memory, astonishing metaphysical boldness, is a complete sustenance, a perfect invention. The great Japanese writer Akutagawa asked what good is intelligence if you can't discover a 'useful melancholy'? Baxter has discovered that, has elevated the very nature of insomnia to a philosophical disquisition, enriches and dignifies the soul of a reader in many other surprising ways as well. This novel is an irreplaceable gift outright; each character we meet in its pages is a turbulent and remarkable presence. Baxter's passionate writing raises the level of regard for life itself, let alone the art of writing. <b>The Feast of Love</b> deserves all lasting attentions and great praise."<br>-- Howard Norman, author of <b>The Bird Artist</b> and <b>The Museum Guard</b><br></p><p>"<b>The Feast of Love</b> is hilarious and at the same time desperately sad, full of wit and poetry and exquisitely observed perceptions of the human condition, erudite and streetwise at once. It conveys the delicacy, the violence, the salvation and the destruction of love. What a brilliant, powerful novel!"<br> -- Alan Lightman<br></p><p>"Rich, strange, alive with the miracles of daily life, this novel is a banquet for the soul. So many wonderful characters, all of whom I came to cherish: Bradley-the-person and Bradley-the-dog, Oscar and delectable Chloe, Esther and Harry and the great sadness of Aaron, not to mention disturbing Diana and the creepy Bat. Oh, everyone. The pleasures of the sets of characters intersecting; of the initial configurations of love reconfiguring themselves by the end. Truly, this is a novel in which the unexpected is always upon us." <br>-- Andrea Barrett, author of <b>Ship Fever</b> and <b>The Voyage of the Narwhal</b></p></p><h2>Booking Hawaii Five-O: An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968-1980 Television Detective Series</h2><p>On September 26, 1968, Hawaii Five-O premiered on CBS.

Wellman, Mervyn Le Roy, Jean Renoir, and Elia Kazan. He played romantic leads alongside the great beauties of the modern screen, including Joan Crawford, Elizabeth Taylor, Greer Garson, Merle Oberon, Linda Darnell, Susan Hayward, Maureen O'Hara, and most important of all, Gene Tierney, with whom he did five films. Retrospectives of his work often elicit high praise for an underrated actor, a master of the minimalist style. His image personified the "male mask" of the 1940s in classic films such as <i>Laura, Fallen Angel</i>, and <i>Where the Sidewalk Ends</i>, in which he played the "masculine ideal of steely impassivity." No comprehensive discussion of film noir can neglect his performances. He was an "actor's actor." </p> <p>Here at last is the complete story of a great actor, his difficult struggle to overcome alcoholism while enjoying the accolades of his contemporaries, a successful term as president of the Screen Actors Guild, and the love of family and friends that never deserted him. Based on diaries, letters, home movies, and other documents, this biography explores the mystery of a poor boy from Texas who made his Hollywood dream come true even as he sought a life apart from the limelight and the backbiting of contemporaries jockeying for prizes and prestige. Called "one of nature's noblemen" by his fellow actor Norman Lloyd, Dana Andrews emerges from <i>Hollywood Enigma</i> as an admirable American success story, fighting his inner demons and ultimately winning.</p></p><p><p>A biography of the great noir actor who perfected the male mask of steely impassivity</p>What&#39;s in a Title?Like other university presses, the University of Press of Mississippi sends books and book proposals to readers who comment on the strengths and weaknesses of submitted manuscripts. Some readers supply general comments, while others provide quite detailed suggestions and corrections. My reader made several helpful remarks, including a proposed title change. My working title was Dana Andrews: Hollywood&#39;s Enigmatic Hero.Like most writers, I felt very attached to my title. I wanted readers to know who the book was about right away, as well as to signal a mystery was at hand. Dana Andrews was a star and played the hero in his films many times. But certain critics noted that his heroes seemed conflicted. They were holding back something, as if they did not quite trust themselves in the heroic roles assigned to them. They exuded vulnerability. In his signature roles, such as the detective in the film noir classic, Laura (1944), he expresses reticence and a tightly-controlled temper that flashes momentarily when he punches Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) in the stomach.If you read about Dana Andrews (his name comes up quite often on websites devoted to Hollywood film), you&#39;ll see references to his understated style, which is usually mentioned as a positive. But you will also read some accounts that claim he was a wooden actor and played all his roles the same way. Only someone unfamiliar with the range of his work can discount his versatility. Watch him play the handsome cad in Daisy Kenyon (1947), the cheerful, zesty reporter in State Fair (1945), the dedicated district attorney in Boomerang (1947), and a Russian peasant in The North Star (1943)--just to name four very different films and performances out of more than sixty--and you will see what I mean. He was a consummate actor, a craftsman&#39;s craftsman, although, of course, he did go through some dreadful periods later in his career when the alcoholism that he eventually overcame got the better of him.Initially, I wanted &#34;hero&#34; in the title because Dana Andrews perfected a certain kind of nobility better than any other actor of his generation. Norman Lloyd, who appeared in two films with Dana, called him &#34;one of nature&#39;s noblemen&#34; in a letter addressed to me, and in another referred to Dana as &#34;a prince among men.&#34; You can see what Lloyd meant in two war pictures, The Purple Heart (1944) and Wing and a Prayer (1944). But even in Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950), in which Dana plays a cop corrupted by his penchant for violence, the basic decency of the man and the character he is portraying emerge.When you watch Dana Andrews in his best, most complex performances, you wonder what he is thinking. The cerebral quality of his greatest work is striking. He is holding back something, and that quality is the enigma. Some part of him-- at least in some performances--seems not to want to emote. He became a star after Laura, but he never became quite the star that Bogart or Cooper or Gable were. They were Hollywood. Dana Andrews was only in Hollywood.He was born Carver Dana Andrews in a small Mississippi town that thought it would be cute to call itself Don&#39;t. (Get it? Don&#39;t, Miss.) His father, an Elmer Gantry-type Baptist preacher, moved his large family (eventually consisting of seven boys and a girl) from one Texas town to another, mobilizing his congregations in anti-drinking campaigns and fulminating against the sinful influence of the movies. One result of this upbringing is that Dana became an alcoholic and a movie star.Put that way, it sounds as though Dana repudiated his father&#39;s example. Well, not exactly. While it is true that by the age of ten he was sneaking away from home to go to the movies, his father&#39;s driving ambition and powerful hold on audiences were also on display in the prodigal son. Although Dana rejected his father&#39;s religion--indeed all religion--that Protestant call to examine one&#39;s conscience and to abide by a strict moral code never deserted the man who became a movie star.Even after he hitchhiked to California in 1930 and started making the rounds of the studios, Dana had mixed feelings about his chosen profession. For nearly a decade he studied singing and thought of opera as a career, and it was a choice his family would have preferred. But lured back to the stage by community theater--first in Van Nuys and then Pasadena--he gradually realized it was to be acting or nothing at all.Yet his diary reveals that he never quite acclimated to theater folk--or to Hollywood for that matter. Discovered in 1938 by one of Sam Goldwyn&#39;s scouts, Dana slowly made his way up the ranks of supporting roles to stardom with Laura in 1944. The decade of his greatness, with roles in The Ox-bow Incident (1943) and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), to name just two of his superb performances, still did not making acting entirely suitable to his temperament. He studiously avoided affairs with leading ladies--most notably Joan Crawford--and cultivated a homebody image. Devoted to his wife and four children, he went to Hollywood parties only when &#34;the job&#34; seemed to call for it. His closest friends tended to be character actors and directors.Dana Andrews wanted to be a great actor, and to get the best roles he also needed to be a star. Sure, he enjoyed the limelight, but he did not grouse when the plum roles began to elude him in the early 1950s, and he had to settle for lesser parts. That Hollywood--for all it gave him--was not his final aim became clear when he quit drinking for good in 1970 and returned to the stage in dinner theater. He often co-starred with his wife, Mary Todd, a consummate comedienne who decided marriage to Dana Andrews and a family were more important than her career. Unlike a lot of husbands in his business, though, Dana never forgot what his wife sacrificed for him, and it gave him profound pleasure to reunite with her on the stage, where he first met her in a production at the Pasadena Playhouse.How this wonderful human being made his way through the phoniness and glitz of Hollywood is quite a story. He was hard to grasp. Few of his fellow professionals ever got to know him. Read Gene Tierney&#39;s autobiography, and you will see what I mean. She starred with Dana in five pictures, and yet she has very little to say about the man who always showed up for work on time, always knew his lines, and was never less than a gentleman.To Sam Goldwyn, Darryl Zanuck, and other producers Dana was an enigma. To many of his fellow actors, he was a hero. In the end, though, I thought my reader&#39;s title better than my own. He suggested: Hollywood Enigma: Dana Andrews. I like it, especially since I cannot count on readers knowing who Dana Andrews was. As the new title indicates, knowing about him has a lot to say about Hollywood in its golden age and decline. Here was a star who refused to be anything other than himself and paid rather a heavy price for his refusal, but still managed to remain his own man. What price, Hollywood, indeed.</p><h2>Your Tarot Your Way: Learn to Read with Any Deck</h2><p><p><strong>Tarot Guidance With A Personal Touch</strong></p> <p>Discover what it's like to receive tarot lessons with a warm and encouraging teacher at your side.

Williams plantation in Georgia was operated largely with the labor of slaves&#x2014;and this was in 1921, 56 years after the Civil War. Williams was not alone in using &#x201c;peons,&#x201d; but his reaction to a federal investigation was almost unbelievable: he decided to destroy the evidence. Enlisting the aid of his trusted black farm boss, Clyde Manning, he began methodically killing his slaves. As this true story unfolds, each detail seems more shocking, and surprises continue in the aftermath, with a sensational trial galvanizing the nation and marking a turning point in the treatment of black Americans.<br></p><p><b>Gregory A. Freeman</b> is the author of <i>Sailors to the End</i> and has written for the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>. He lives in Roswell, Georgia.<br>Freeman's first book has a subtitle calculated to bring readers up short. Plantation slaves in 1921? Therein lies a horrifying tale of the Old South. A Georgia-based journalist, Freeman first came across this story when his hometown, Atlanta, was hosting the 1996 Olympics (although it was widely covered even in the northern press at the time of the events described in the book). Although slavery theoretically died with the Confederacy, in the Jim Crow South there were still forms of debt bondage, called peonage, that were little more than gussied-up versions of the ``peculiar institution.'' A young black man would find himself arrested for some minor offense and issued a fine that he would be unable to pay; a local farmer would pay his fine and put him to work under slavery-like conditions, ostensibly to pay off this unasked-for loan. In the case of gentleman farmer John S. Williams, the result could be death by beating, bludgeoning, shooting, or drowning. Williams, unwillingly aided by his black overseer, Clyde Manning, murdered eleven of his plantation workers in 1921 when he thought that the nascent Bureau of Investigation (later the FBI) was considering federal charges against him for peonage. Eventually, the story came to the surface with a trio of the corpses he and Manning had tossed into a nearby river. Remarkably, Williams was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, primarily on Manning's testimonythe first white southern male convicted of first-degree murder of a black man or woman since 1877. (It would be 45 years before it would happen again.) Freeman walks the reader through the eleven murders and their aftermath with cool detachment. The book is scrupulously researched, with an eye for the telling detail. A good true-crime story, with far-reaching implications.

Col. Jesse A. Marcel, Sr., May 5, 1981</h2><p>Major Jesse Marcel was the intelligence officer for the 509th Composite Bomb Group of the Army Air Force stationed at Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. At the beginning of World War II, Roswell Army Airfield opened and became home to the 509th bombardment group, the only Atomic Bomber wing in the world. Major Marcel was a key witness and one of the first military personnel to handle the wreckage of an extraterrestrial spaceship crashed near Roswell in the early days of July 1947. The very fact that this man not only touched what he believed to be a space craft not of this earth, but had pieces of it in his home, is utterly amazing. In 1947 there were no television documentaries on UFO sightings as we have today. There were no support groups for people who claimed to have had a close encounter of some kind, as today. How do you live your life after something like this happens to you? How did Jesse cope with the fact that this incident changed his life? What did Jesse now believe that he didn&#39;t believe before the incident? Why did he wait 32 years before coming out with his story? And would he draw what he saw? This book will reveal the only hand drawn depiction of the debris found at Roswell - from an actual eye witness who was at the crash site.</p><p>The author was born in Atlanta, Texas and raised in Golden Meadow, Louisiana on the banks of Bayou Lafourche near the Gulf of Mexico - one hour south of New Orleans.

In a highly provocative interpretation of the decision's connection to the civil rights movement, Klarman argues that <em>Brown</em> was more important for mobilizing southern white opposition to racial change than for encouraging direct-action protest. <em>Brown</em> unquestioningly had a significant impact--it brought race issues to public attention and it mobilized supporters of the ruling. It also, however, energized the opposition. In this authoritative account of constitutional law concerning race, Michael Klarman details, in the richest and most thorough discussion to date, how and whether Supreme Court decisions do, in fact, matter.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Michael J. Klarman</strong> is the James Monroe Distinguished Professor of Law and Professor of History at the University of Virginia. After graduating from Stanford Law School, Klarman clerked for the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg and then earned his D. Phil. from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia with his spouse, Lisa Landsverk, and their four children.<br><br>"Michael J. Klarman's monumental book--undertaking a sweeping exploration of the causes and consequences of all of the Supreme Court's race decisions from <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> to <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em>--is likely to become the definitive study of the Supreme Court and race in the first half of the twentieth century. As a narrative history of the Court's actions on the broad array of constitutional issues relevant to racial equality--from criminal procedure to voting rights to desegregation--the book is an invaluable resource."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"Klarman's scholarly text is unique in that it encompasses not only the decision itself, but also the events before and after."--Elaine Cassel, author of <em>The War on Civil Liberties</em><p></p><br>"This luminous study explores the relationship between the Supreme Court and the quest for racial justice.... a sweeping, erudite, and powerfully argued book that, despite its heft, is unfailingly interesting."--<em>Wilson Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Michael Klarman's authoritative account of constitutional law concerning race--from the late 19th century through the 1960s--is brilliant, both as legal interpretation and as social and political history. While the book deals with a wide range of racially charged issues--criminal procedure, peonage, transportation, residential segregation, and voting rights--it focuses with especially keen insights on the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> case of 1954. <em>From Jim Crow to Civil Rights</em> is a magisterial accomplishment." --James T. Patterson, Bancroft Prize-winning author of <em>Grand Expectations:</em> <em>The United States, 1945-1974</em> (Oxford, 1996)<p></p><br>"Michael Klarman's exhaustively researched study is essential reading for anyone interested in civil rights, the Supreme Court, and constitutional law. Accessible to ordinary readers, students, and scholars, Klarman's book presents a challenging argument that places the Supreme Court's civil rights decisions in their social and political context, and deflates overstated claims for the importance of the Supreme Court's work while identifying carefully the precise contributions the Court made to race relations policy from 1896 through the 1960s."--Mark Tushnet, author of <em>Taking the Constitution</em> <em>Away from the Courts</em><p></p><br>"Pulling together a decade of truly magnificent scholarship, this extraordinary book bids fair to be the definitive legal history of perhaps the most important legal issue of the twentieth century. There is no one from whom I have learned more--and whom I enjoy reading more--than Michael Klarman. This is legal history at its best, and on a panoramic canvas."--Akhil Reed Amar, author of <em>The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction</em><p></p><br>"<em>From Jim Crow to Civil Rights</em> is a bold, carefully crafted, deeply researched, forcefully argued, lucidly written history of law and legal-change strategies in the civil rights movement from the 1880s to the 1960s, and a brilliant case study in the power and limits of law as a motor of social change. Among the hundreds of recent books on the history of civil rights and race relations, Klarman's is one of the most original, provocative, and illuminating, with fresh evidence and fresh insights on practically every page."--Robert W. Gordon, Chancellor Kent Professor of Law and Legal History, Yale University<p></p><br>"Michael J.

In general, they do not provide restrictive interpretation; rather they open the text up to alternative readings. . . . More importantly, the translation is accompanied by useful notes that either focus on the text itself (e.g. on the etymology and meaning of words) or go beyond it (e.g., they offer additional information about the characters of the dialogue and its intertexts). . . .

Texts from the school of classical Indian philosophy that bears this name are concerned with cognition, reasoning, and the norms that govern rational debate. This translation of selections from the early school of Ny&#x101;ya focuses on its foundational text, the <i>Ny&#x101;ya-s&#x16b;tra</i> (c. 200 CE), with excerpts from the early commentaries. It will be welcomed by specialists and non-specialists alike seeking an accessible text that both represents some of the best of Indian philosophical thought and can be integrated into courses on Indian philosophy, religion, and intellectual culture.</p><p><b>Matthew Dasti</b> is Associate Professor of Philosophy, Bridgewater State University.<br><br><b>Stephen Phillips</b> is Professor of Philosophy and Asian Studies, The University of Texas at Austin."Matthew Dasti and Stephen Phillips have done the philosophical world, and teachers and students of philosophy, a great favor in presenting this superb translation of major portions of the <i>Ny&#x101;ya-s&#x16b;tra</i> with selections from its most important commentaries. This text is central to the history of Indian epistemology and metaphysics, and was influential well beyond the world of Ny&#x101;ya, and its most important philosophical passages are presented here. Dasti and Phillips&#x2019; translations of this often-technical text are fluent and clear, rendering it in accessible but precise philosophical English. Their explanatory notes are clear, accurate, and concise. The inclusion of substantial extracts of the commentaries of V&#x101;tsy&#x101;yana, V&#x101;caspatimi&#x15b;ra, and Uddyotakara is especially welcome. Not only do these masterful commentaries extend and explain the philosophical ideas in the s&#x16b;tra, but they demonstrate to the reader the importance of reading this text through the commentarial tradition it inspires and the vitality of that tradition. This will be a valuable resource to scholars as well as to teachers and students."<br> &#x2014;Jay Garfield, Professor of Philosophy, Smith College<br><br>"I have been teaching Introduction to Hindu Philosophy courses for almost twenty years and have always lamented the lack of a usable, student-friendly reader on Ny&#x101;ya, which, of all the Vedic schools, is the one most committed to rational argumentation.

Bryant, Professor of Religion, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey<br><br>"A text that will give students ready access to arguments in support of Ny&#x101;ya views on important topics in metaphysics, epistemology and value theory. The chapter on the self, for instance, lays out clearly the arguments for its existence based on such considerations as cross-modal synthesis, memory, agency and the occurrence of moral properties. Students will be able to follow these arguments. So a philosophy instructor who teaches Buddhist arguments for non-self and wants to fulfill their obligation as a philosopher, will no longer need to themselves supply possible objections to the Buddhist view. Instead they can simply allow the Ny&#x101;ya-Buddhist debate over the self to play out in the words of the original interlocutors. . . . Those of us who wish to see classical Indian philosophy take its rightful place in the undergraduate philosophy curriculum should celebrate its publication. . . . Let us hope that other scholars now take up the task of supplying comparable volumes for other parts of the classical Indian philosophical tradition.

The Market Profile is an ever-evolving, multidimensional graphic that gives visual form to the market's continuing auction process, revealing the myriad underlying dynamics that influence market activity. Behavioral finance posits that investors are driven more by emotional factors and the subjective interpretation of minutia than by "rationality" when making investment decisions. And neuroeconomics is the study of how investor psychology permeates and affects the financial markets. Mr. Dalton explicates the ways in which irrational human behavior influences the market's natural auction process, creating frequently predictable market structure, which results in opportunities for investors to ameliorate risk. The book will improve investors ability to interpret change in markets, enabling better, more confident investment decisions.</p><p>Fifteen years since publishing Mind over Markets--their seminal work on markets and investor behavior--Dalton, Jones, and Dalton have greatly expanded their scope, delving deeply into the ways in which the auction process reveals the actions of all investor time frames. They believe that by understanding timeframe behavior through developing market structure, it is possible to identify asymmetric opportunities that can ameliorate risk and help ensure financial dominance.<br> <br> <p>This book is a bold call to action for all investors--from day traders through the longest-term individual investors, to traditional asset managers and hedge funds that control trillions of dollars. It challenges serious traders, investors, and researchers to reach beyond price-based market analysis and traditional fundamental research for a more contextual approach . . . an approach that translates the principles of behavioral finance into actionable reality by examining the relationship between price, time, and volume.</p> <p>The authors take a profoundly different approach toward the traditional separation between day, short-, intermediate-, and long-term investors, pointing out that even the longest-term professional investor is a day trader on the day they enter, exit, trim, or add to a position. Lead author Jim Dalton and coauthor Eric Jones--having been heavily involved in selecting hedge funds and traditional managers for a leading Wall Street financial services firm--can attest to the importance of each basis point of performance in a world where one quarter's results can trigger financial triumph or a quick exodus.</p> <p>In May of 2006, two months before the book was to be delivered to the publisher, the U.S. stock market broke eight percent in a matter of days--sending investors and the media into a tailspin. The authors saw this as an opportunity to demonstrate their theories in real-time, as opposed to cherry-picking historical events that supported their claims. The event unfolds in Chapter 6 and the authors offer sound advice and strategies on how to navigate market activity yet to unfold. The results are summarized in the Appendix, which was written after the book was submitted to the publisher. You be the judge.</p> <p>Filled with in-depth insight and expert advice, Markets in Profile teaches you the market's basic auction process, redefines how to view and conduct research, separates the markets into different time frames, illustrates the importance of inventory imbalances, and, in sum, demystifies market behavior by showing you how to organize the market's auction process in a scientific, systematic way.</p><b>Praise for MARKETS in PROFILE</b> <p>"Good books teach, but the best books enlighten. <i>Markets in Profile</i> is much more than a lucid explanation of the Market Profile and its application; it is an enlightening perspective on auction markets and the principles underlying all trading, regardless of time frame.

This book is ideally suited for a Christian audience who wishes to significantly extend his or her knowledge of mathematics while developing biblical perspectives on the mathematical-philosophical questions posed in each section. Among other compelling issues, readers will wrestle with questions as to the relationships between God, nature, mathematics, and humans. The integration of Christian thought is weaved throughout the text. [**Note: there are two versions of this book. Read below for more details.] Through the mathematics content presented in this book, you will broaden your understanding of geometry by investigating dimensions, fractals, topological equivalence, and other geometries. You will develop your reasoning skills through identifying deception in statistics, discriminating between cause and correlation, evaluating various voting methods, and exploring chaos theory. Finally, you will refine your understanding of numbers and systems through studying prime, figurate, vampire, narcissistic, powerful, abundant, and transcendental numbers. After studying each mathematical topic, you will consider how the topic informs your answers to questions like: Who are we? What is the nature of reality? How do we know if something is true? What is good? What is beautiful? These questions and their related sub-questions have been part of the human experience from the dawn of human history. Considering how mathematics helps to inform these questions provides for a deeper, more meaningful understanding of mathematics and our world. This book is ideal for: - An undergraduate &#x201c;Mathematics for Liberal Arts&#x201d; course at a Christian college - A half-year senior mathematics elective as part of a focus on worldview at a Christian high school - A Christian homeschool family that wishes to extend their children&#x2019;s learning beyond the standard curriculum in a Christian centered context - Anyone interested in extending his or her own understanding of the scope and depth of mathematics Each section features: - Introductory exercises that prompt the reader to recall relevant information or skills - Concept development sections that explain the mathematics for even the math-phobic student - Content sections that connect the mathematics to literature, art, music, science, and other subjects - A &#x201c;Something to Consider&#x201d; section that asks the reader to think about related enduring questions from a Christian perspective - &#x201c;Covering the Reading&#x201d; questions that help to process the text - &#x201c;Problems&#x201d; that require the reader to research and consider the topic more thoroughly [** There is another version of this book titled "The Mathematical Expanse: Excursions into the Enduring Questions."

I loved eating out. I loved restaurants. Longchamps was pink, it had natty Art Deco furniture, and it was French. There was French onion soup au gratin and a ma�tre d&#x2019; in a tux. His name was Mr. Naigish.<br> <br>There were years when we had Thanksgiving at Longchamps. This gave my father quite a bit of pleasure. He invited the family. He paid. My pop, who wore bow ties and drank martinis, sometimes ordered wine as well. I&#x2019;m sure it both impressed and pissed off his brothers&#x2014;my uncles were rye-drinking kind of men, rye in the old sense, not rye made by hipsters in little hats&#x2014;who had to trek in from Flatbush, from ancestral Brooklyn.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s more, Mr. Naigish addressed my parents by name. This was my first inkling that to be a regular, to be known at a neighborhood restaurant, even regarded as friends, made you special. Over at the Steak Joint on Greenwich Avenue, Dan Stampler called my parents Sally and Sam. This was the thing I was crazy about, this feeling you were an insider in a singular little society.<br> <br>I was a fat, smart, nosy little girl, and God knows I liked the food, but I loved the people: the uptown crowd in suits and minks, slumming in the Village; local families out for spaghetti and meatballs; the artists, writers, and musicians arguing at coffee shops over immense slabs of pie and coffee. Even more interesting were the people who worked at restaurants, out front or behind the scenes: the singing waiters at Asti&#x2019;s on Twelfth Street; the occasional real Frenchman at Charles French Restaurant; the one-armed waiter at Frank&#x2019;s Pizzeria on Bleecker Street, his empty shirt sleeve pinned back, who tossed the pies with the brio of a juggler on The Ed Sullivan Show.<br> <br>Then there were the waitresses at Schrafft&#x2019;s where my mother took me on special occasions for ham and Swiss on toasted cheese bread served by these plain Irish girls in hairnets and black uniforms. Some of them had been hired just off the boats, my mother said. It sounded like a kind of spooky religious order. I longed to ask about their lives, these women far away from home. Where did they live? Who were they?<br> <br>At the Coach House&#x2014;it was located in an actual old coaching house on Waverly Place&#x2014;black waiters in white gloves served dinner. The idea was that you were dining on all-American food in some theme park little version of another age, perhaps down south. It was unusual, too, in a city where if you went out to eat you generally ate French or Italian or maybe blintzes at Ratner&#x2019;s. The fried chicken, the corn bread made in special black iron molds, and the black bean soup were all delicious. The owner, Mr. Leon Lianides, was imposing and, unless you were quite famous, a little intimidating. Still, everyone else was very nice, very gracious. I always wondered, though, if after they finished work, when the waiters took off their white gloves, they also retired their smiles for the night.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Longchamps, the Steak Joint, Charles, the Grand Ticino, the Cookery, the Sea Fare, all gone now. My parents are gone; the restaurants, gone. The bars, too. Bradley&#x2019;s, the Cedar on University Place, where Jack Kerouac, it was said, pissed in the ashtray. As kids, we went trick-or-treating at the Cedar because instead of candy, you always got cash.<br> <br>What I took with me from childhood was that sense of a different world where you might be admitted or at least given a glimpse. Anytime a ma�tre d&#x2019; hugged me or a waiter called out my name or a bartender offered me one on the house, I felt I was in; I had arrived.<br> <br>The truth is, I guess, I&#x2019;ve always been on the lookout for a place where I could embed myself: a local bar, a restaurant, a coffee shop. Maybe it&#x2019;s simply that lifelong yearning for community, the driving force in the life of a lonely only child.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>&#x201c;Top of the goddamn morning to you,&#x201d; said the good-looking young guy at the door as I stumbled into Balthazar around eight most days. James Weichert, the young guy, was always in a loud Hawaiian shirt, an impish grin on his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;My shirt was not Hawaiian, it was Comme des Gar�ons,&#x201d; James says now.<br> <br>At first I ate alone in the bar area, read the paper, and chatted to James. I had been assigned a piece about boats for the Financial Times. I hate boats. It turned out that James, though, was an enthusiastic sailor who had just joined the gay and lesbian Knickerbocker Sailing Association in the hope of meeting a nice guy he could settle down with and who also loved boats.<br> <br>&#x201c;You should meet some of the other regulars,&#x201d; he said one morning.<br> <br>So it was James who introduced me to Steven Zwerling and Rona Middleberg. Soon, I was eating breakfast with them every day, hurrying to get out of the house.<br> <br>&#x201c;Breakfast is about mortality,&#x201d; Steven Zwerling said. Almost every morning, perhaps to stave off his sense of finite time, he ordered the same thing&#x2014;two oatmeal scones, two blueberry jams.<br> <br>Steve, who worked for the Ford Foundation then, was king of the morning, boss of Balthazar breakfasts. Of breakfast, he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the most biological of meals. The fast is broken, of course, but also it comes upon many of us who are only half emerged from sleep and all its demands. We drag ourselves over to Balthazar. The coffee that arrives to make everything better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We distract each other with stories, occasional frustration, even rage at the rest of the world, a couple of useful insights, a little compassion and understanding. And laughing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erudite, funny, mournful, and very tall, Steve was a repository of New York stories. He had met&#x2014;or seen&#x2014;everyone: Jackie Robinson, the Rosenbergs laid out in their caskets at a funeral parlor in Brooklyn, Fidel Castro. When Castro visited Columbia University in 1958, Steven, a student then, rushed out of the crowd to shake Fidel&#x2019;s hand. Fidel was very tall, too, and handsome.<br> <br>Steven was married to Rona Middleberg. Rona always sat facing the front door and could thus check out everyone who came in. Small, beautiful, musical, with long brown hair and a soft manner that belied her skepticism and stainless steel business brilliance, she seemed to run half of NYU. Rona liked a pain au chocolat in the morning, though she could be persuaded to share a sticky bun from time to time.<br> <br>Breakfast&#x2014;the communal breakfast at Balthazar&#x2014;really came together in the aftermath of 9/11 when the whole city, especially downtown Manhattan, leaned in toward itself for comfort. For months, the large black cloud hung over the hole in the ground where the World Trade Center had been. I could see it from my place in SoHo. When I&#x2019;d left town on September 9, the Twin Towers were there. I came home a week later, and they were gone, evaporated, disappeared, turned to dust. The smell never went away. At Balthazar within a few days of the attack, people hurried in, looking for some kind of solace, or at least coffee. &#x201c;Have one on us,&#x201d; one of the managers said to everyone who entered. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re glad to see you.&#x201d; Code for Glad you&#x2019;re alive.<br> <br>Those mornings it was never crowded, though you might see an artist slumped over his bowl of caf� au lait, up unnaturally early, having stumbled in looking for caffeine.<br> <br>We became a gang. An ad hoc group of people&#x2014;writers, teachers, a performance artist, a Wall Street lawyer who occasionally appeared in very tight spandex bike shorts&#x2014;we referred to ourselves (ironically, of course&#x2014;this was Manhattan, after all) as the &#x201c;Balthazaristas.&#x201d; I published a piece called &#x201c;Breakfast at Balthazar&#x201d; in the FT Magazine. Friends began calling up, asking delicately if they could come by, as if we were a secret cult, the Skull and Bones of Spring Street.<br> <br>Most days by eight-thirty we were in place, tables 81 and 82 pushed together, plenty of room in case David Easton showed up. An august interior designer, David was always beautifully dressed, usually wanting a glass of red wine even at eight in the morning, often with a very funny, very dirty joke to make us laugh. He&#x2019;d drink up and be off to Charlottesville or Aspen.<br> <br>We had our own share of celebrity spottings: Jon Stewart with his then young family; Mel Brooks, who came and sat with us for a little while and made us laugh so hard we gagged on the sticky buns; Nigella Lawson, who popped in for a hefty slice or two of fruit focaccia. She was a girl who loved to eat. Once she said to me, &#x201c;Those diets that say you can have one cookie, do you think they mean one bag of cookies?&#x201d;<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>We talked. Argued. Bitched. A bit bored one year, we complained that there was no matzo during Passover, though none of us was the tiniest bit observant. The staff produced matzo. Rona said she made a great matzo brei and was allowed into the kitchen to make it. The rest of us were as envious as if she&#x2019;d been awarded a backstage pass to a rock concert. We had always been curious about the unseen life at Balthazar.<br> <br>Over the months and then years, we kept talking, no subject forbidden: new jobs, family feuds, old loves, vacations, the Yankees, cancer. There was much discussion of disease; colonoscopies were a favorite topic. At first we felt this was because we were all, one way or the other, neurotic New York Jews. Then, one day, Maria Aitken, the English actor and director, popped in for a croissant and stayed to tell us the story of her colonoscopy, and how she failed to understand the pain until she heard herself from a distance, moaning like a cow.<br> <br>Mostly what I remember about those years of breakfast at Balthazar, though, were the jokes, the uncontrollable laughter.<br> <br>For years I could barely stand to miss a breakfast. And then, like everything, it changed. The breakfast menu grew. Packs of alien financial types began appearing. James left and got his MBA. Steven and Rona spent more time in Florida to be close to Steve&#x2019;s mother, who died at a hundred and seven. Until she hit a hundred, she often came to breakfast with us.<br> <br>Suddenly Balthazar was going on twenty. Like all long-running love affairs, breakfast at Balthazar became habit. There were the inevitable irritations: What to do about someone who suddenly started showing up regularly and whom we did not really like? Should we all pay our own checks instead of each picking it up in turn? Was the table too crowded? Were we laughing less?<br> <br>But those mornings, with the sun coming through the windows, Balthazar was at its most tranquil. The old French mirrors, the pewter surface of the long bar, the wood, the white-and-black tile floors gave you a sense of d�paysement&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think this has a true translation, this French word for feeling you&#x2019;re far away in another country. It wasn&#x2019;t France, but who cared?<br> <br>Adam Gopnik, the author and New Yorker writer, said, &#x201c;Balthazar is an elaborate re-creation of an imaginary place, not a fake but a delicate hybrid, a product of this city, of New York as much as Paris.&#x201d; A country of the mind, Balthazar was a restaurant that reminded me of my childhood dreams of New York.<br> <br>In the end, breakfast at Balthazar, and Balthazar itself, was, for me, about the fulfillment of that terrible longing for community. I thought it might last forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just breakfast,&#x201d; Rona said one morning. Nobody believed her.</p><h2>The Last Lie: The gripping must-read psychological crime thriller from the Sunday Times bestselling author</h2><p><p><b>The twisty new psychological thriller from the <em>USA Today</em> bestselling author of <em>After Anna</em>, <em>Killing Kate</em> and <em>Copycat</em></b></p><p><strong>Everyone lies...but some lies are deadly.</strong></p><p>For Claire Daniels, life is good.

Spanning more than a half century, from an impassioned essay on human nature, wartime atrocities, and their challenge to ethical beliefs, written in 1942 in the form of a letter to his friend Jerzy Andrzejewski, to brief biographical sketches and poetic prose pieces from the late 1990s, this volume presents Milosz the prose writer in all his multiple, beguiling guises. The incisive, sardonic analyst of the seductive power of communism is also the author of tender, elegiac portraits of friends famous and obscure; the witty commentator on Polish complexes writes lyrically of the California landscape. Two great themes predominate in these essays, several of which have never appeared before in English: Milosz's personal struggle to sustain his religious faith, and his unswerving allegiance to a poetry that is "on the side of man."</p></p><p><p><b>Czeslaw Milosz </b>was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature.

The short climb to its flat summit on the trail used by miners well over a century ago, past cavernous tunnels, the ruins of the Modoc smelters, and the ghost town of 1880s Lookout, is a rare experience. It gives a glimpse of the life of the men who toiled here to harvest nearly $2,500,000 of silver from the mountain. The view of the Panamint Range is spectacular.</i> </p><p><b>General Information</b><br> </p><li><i>Jurisdiction:</i> Private claims on BLM land</li> <li><i>Road status:</i> Climbing on trails and cross-country; graded access road</li> <li><i>The climb:</i> 1.7 mi, 1,350 ft up one way/moderate</li> <li><i>Main attractions:</i> Historic silver mine, ghost town, trail climb</li> <li><i>USGS 7.5' topo maps:</i> Panamint Springs, Revenue Canyon*</li> <li><i>Maps:</i> pp. 523*, 499 <p><b>Location and Access</b> </p><p>Lookout Mountain is a colorful, steep-sided promontory of folded Devonian limestone and dolomite, in the northern Argus Range. With a strong high-clearance four-while-drive vehicle, one can drive a rough stony road right up to its summit, but to climb it on foot all you need is a standard-clearance vehicle. First work your way on Highway 190 to Panamint Springs, 45.2 miles east of Olancha, then to the Panamint Valley Road 2.5 miles east of it. Drive this road 7.4 miles southeast to the signed Minnietta Road on the right. Take this wide graded road 3.6 miles east, over Ash Hill, until it veers north and merges with the Nadeau Trail, signed P 105, coming in from the left. Lookout Mountain rises just to the west. Continue north 0.4 mile to a fork. Angle left on the Nadeau Trail Cutoff, and go 0.35 mile to a junction. The left fork is the way to the summit. It gets rapidly rough, so park at this junction. </p><p><b>Route Description</b> </p><p>Lookout Mountain was made famous by a large silver lode discovered near its summit in April 1875. The discovery attracted Senator George Hearst&#x2015;his son would later build Hearst Castle&#x2015;who promptly bought into the claims and formed the Modoc Consolidated Mining Company. The area was so rich that after a few veins had been opened, it was incorporated into a new mining district. Inspired by the open views from the mine, the mountain and the town that grew near the mine were named Lookout. The ore was initially teamed to Panamint City for smelting. In 1876, desert freighter Remi Nadeau delivered to Lookout two 30-ton smelting furnaces. First fired up in October, they produced around 10 tons of silver-lead bullion daily. The charcoal needed to reduce the ore was at first made from pinyon pine logged on this range. By the end of 1876, this scant wood supply was nearly depleted, and Hearst turned to the extensive forest in Wildrose Canyon, across Panamint Valley. Up in the canyon the company erected ten large kilns, which were activated in the spring of 1877. In May, Lookout boasted 30 or 40 houses and stone buildings, three saloons, two general stores, and a bank. Three times a week, a stagecoach connected it to Darwin and Panamint City. By the summer of 1878, the furnaces had churned out over $1,000,000 worth of bullion. For reasons not well understood, the kilns and furnaces were shut down a year later. But there was still plenty of ore, and mining continued. By 1890, the Modoc Mine had produced about $1,900,000, and joined the hall of fame as one of the richest silver mines in the Death Valley region. </p><p>In its early history, two shortcuts gave quick access to the mine. The Pack Trail was built for pack animals; the China Wall Trail, much steeper, was for humans. Its namesake is the Chinese employees who built it, and perhaps also its construction: most of it was supported by curvy stone walls, like the Great Wall of China. To get to it from the road junction, hike up the road 0.45 mile to, then in, a steep canyon, to the foot of the tailing and large retaining wall of the Lower Tunnel. Walk up the short tailing to the top of the wall, then go about 25 yards to the left, away from the tunnel. The China Wall Trail starts on the right, just before a cable anchored to the mountain. This narrow foot trail was built to last&#x2015;and it did. Other than a small landslide and a litter of stones loosened by the local burros, it is essentially intact after 140 years. In 0.4 mile it switchbacks 430 feet up the steep canyon head to a saddle on Lookout Mountain&#x2019;s northeast shoulder, where it joins the Pack Trail. The name Lookout is instantly justified when you reach the saddle and succumb to the first gorgeous view of Panamint Valley. </p><p>The trail continues 0.15 mile up the more gentle ridge until it ends at the road at the Modoc Mine. Continue west on the road; be very careful, and avoid walking here at night, as the area has many deep open shafts, including one right in the middle of the road. Here as all along the Pack Trail, slag litters the ground. These shiny black pebbles were formed in the smelters when charcoal combined chemically with the silver ore. Four of the Modoc Mine&#x2019;s main tunnels are located along this stretch. Most of the historic production came out of the two Lookout Mountain split 500-foot tunnels of Level No. 2, the first adit below the road. The two long, superposed stone platforms on the right side of the road just a little further is the site of the 1876 smelters. Although it is one of the region&#x2019;s oldest ghost towns, Lookout still has five stone buildings and the ruins of at least two dozen more. The largest structure, right by the road past the smelters site, is a prime example of desert mining camp architecture in the 1880s, its two-foot-thick walls of carefully laid angular rocks and portions of its rafters still defying gravity. </p><p>From there it is a short walk up the broad ridge (or the road) to the summit. Lookout Mountain was so full of silver that there is a shaft even at its very top, as well as three stone buildings for the miners who liked their room with a view. The barren summit knoll is indeed a spectacular lookout over the 75-mile length of Panamint Valley, from the pale dunes and dry lake in the northern basin to the southern basin&#x2019;s salt pan, all sprawled below the majestic Panamint Range. </p><p>To return a different way, hike back to the saddle and go down the Pack Trail. In 0.35 mile it ends at the bottom of a canyon. Continue down waves of white-marble slickrock, then along the canyon&#x2019;s stony wash, to the canyon mouth.

Women abolitionists joined together in community building, political organizing, and building private and professional female networks. In doing so, they discovered that to gain a public audience they needed simultaneously to act like "true women" in working for moral reforms such as temperance and education while also stepping out of conventional "middle-class" female roles to speak and write against slavery. Such activism led toward women's rights, yet blacks abjured association with white reformers unsupportive of racial uplift. Racism among reformers propelled black women reformers toward separate action and identity. Yee's complex argument demands serious attention from those trying to unravel the contradicions in the reform tradition. Recommended for university libraries.<br><i>- Randall M.

In this book Tara Sanchez draws together her knowledge of ancient practices and literature merging it with her personal experiences and ideas.</p><p>Thoroughly modern, but steeped in history, this is a book of rituals, meditations, divinations and other techniques through which the reader is invited to explore the magick of this ancient goddess of the crossroads, sorcery and witchcraft. The reader is introduced to essential practices such as keeping a magickal journal, setting up the altar, ritual purification, sacred space, preparing incenses and making a ritual robe; as well as more advanced practices such as ritual gestures, sacred vowels and dream incubation.</p><p>Other techniques covered include knot magick and phylacteries, psychic development and the use of banishing rituals. The exercises in this book present the beginner with everything they need, and the experienced practitioner with a new and fresh perspective. Divination is a very popular area of study amongst those interested in modern witchcraft and magic, and this book presents a unique Hekatean approach to using and interpreting the Major Arcana of the Tarot.</p><p>Through drawing together ideas from ancient literature and applying it to modern works, the author has created the Oracle of Her Sacred Fires. This oracle is a system of divination by dice and draws on the writings of dozens of modern priests, priestesses and mystics who contributed to the anthology Hekate Her Sacred Fires (d&#x2019;Este, 2010) &#x2013; a wonderful blend of old and new!</p><p>The comprehensive appendixes provide additional reference material which can be used to enhance workings with the Goddess Hekate. They include material on Hekate and the other Gods, herbs, plant and animal correspondences, other spiritual beings such as daemons, the winds and the four elements &#x2013; as well as techniques for reduction sigils and planetary hours. Filled with a blend of ancient and modern wisdom, ritual, technique and theory &#x2013; this book is essential reading for complete beginners, intermediate students and experienced hands who are looking for relevant 21st century insights and ideas, which also honour the past &#x2013; and in the process it opens up entirely new ways through which to explore the magick of the Goddess Hekate today.</p></p><p>Once upon a time there was a little girl who took all the other children in the street seriously when they said that if you went to the playground at midnight and skipped around the swings backwards three times the fairies would appear. So she set her alarm, snuck out the house and did as she had been instructed, the other children never did believe her when she recounted her tale. But as a result that little girl grew up to be only a slightly bigger girl with very wild hair and sometimes rather wild eyes who never stopped searching for fairies in the playground and trolls under bridges, and who harkened to things that went bump in the night and often pondered the source of those half whispered secrets in the quiet time just between wakefulness and sleep. In her twenties she embarked on a quest to find the meaning of life the universe and everything and was rather alarmed to discover that indeed one answer could be the number 42, it has been pretty much downhill since then. Although Kentish Maid by birth (NOT a Maid of Kent) Tara currently resides on the Cheshire/Derbyshire border with her long suffering husband, beautiful and precocious daughter and a gaggle of cats and can often be discovered getting pixie led in the peaks or spinning on her beloved spinning wheel, one day she may actually get some proper work done. She is always happy to correspond with anybody genuinely interested in the Mysteries and can be contacted by email at the following address: enquiries@templeofhekate.net<p>This book was recommended to me by the author of Her Sacred Fires, Sorita De Estes who also has a Youtube channel by that name. I am extremely pleased by the content of this book. Even though a few of the chapters review various forms of exercises relating to the basics of ritual preparation predominantly of Greek antiquity origin (setting up altars, various info on the elements, winds, Hecate incense formulas, the bulk of the book is written in an almost scholarly format including footnotes concerning who the Goddess is, various origins possibilities, many great devotional exercises and even ancient hand gestures relating to Hecate. It is one of the few credible books on Hecate in my opinion. mainly because most of the book is NOIT the authors opinions and assumptions. Sanchez pretty much sticks to actual historical/cultural/ mythical information which is well documented by her research. I especially value the exercises and authentic devotional practices meant to enhance and further develop your own relationship and interaction with the Goddess Hecate. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is sincerely interested in this Goddess. - <em>michele braun, Amazon reviewer</em></p></p><h2>Fowl Language: Winging It: The Art of Imperfect Parenting (Volume 3)</h2><p><b>The perfect gift for baby showers and for those already in the throes of parenting, <i>Fowl Language: Winging It</i> is here to let you know that you're not alone.

Accidents of environment and genetics contributed to the emergence of sentient beings like us. Today, however, people no longer "just happen"; they are created by the voluntary acts of other people.<br><br> This book examines several questions about the ethics of human existence. Is it a good thing, for humans, that humans "happened"? Is it ethical to keep making new humans, now that reproduction is under our control? And given that a person exists (through no fault or choice of his own), is it immoral or irrational for him to refuse to live out his natural lifespan? Sarah Perry answers these questions in the negative--not out of misanthropy, but out of empathy for human suffering and respect for human autonomy.<br><br> "<em>Every Cradle Is a Grave</em> undertakes a difficult task&#x2014;to write on discomforting matters from a perspective that is socially unsanctioned. Strange as it may seem to some of us, there are scads of volumes that praise the abuses we endure in our lives. Such works have always been well thumbed, though they are only prayer-books for the purpose of worshiping misery. Sarah Perry is more honest and less perverse on the subject of suffering, treating pain as both a philosophical and a practical problem to which, it is admitted, there is no ultimate solution. Nonetheless, in her view there still remains intelligence and compassion as a means for confronting the insoluble. That is what makes this book as much a necessity as it is a rarity."<br><br> --Thomas Ligotti, author of <em>The Conspiracy against the Human Race</em><br><br> Meaning. Value. Birth. Death. Sanctity. These subjects and others are reexamined through the lens of suicide rights and procreation ethics in Sarah Perry's <em>Every Cradle Is a Grave</em>. If you're at all fond of asking the truly Big Questions, this is the read you've been waiting for. Why are we here, and why do we stay? Prepare to have your assumptions dissected and turned on their heads. It's a bumpy ride, but then, so is this little journey we're on as we spin aimlessly around a sun that's destined to burn out, just as surely as each individual life will one day fall back down into the mud from which all life arises. Asking the hard questions is one thing, but hearing answers that might shake us to the core can be something else again.<br><br> --Jim Crawford, author of <em>Confessions of an Antinatalist</em><br><br> "In this eminently rational, clear and serious book, Sarah Perry is courageous and strong enough to confront the forbidden truths of human life. <em>Every Cradle Is a Grave</em> should be mandatory reading for anyone who plans to have children."<br><br> &#x2013;Mikita Brottman, author of <em>Thirteen Girls</em></p><p>Sarah Perry is a housewife who lives in San Antonio, Texas.</p><h2>Classical Gods and Heroes</h2><p>All the wonder, terror and delight of Greek mythology springs forth from the pages of this unique and much-needed anthology.

Full of clear-eyed explorations of the natural world, witty cultural observations, and heart-warming family connections, <i>How to Cuss in Western</i> is a cranky and hilarious love letter of sorts to the western Great Basin Desert of Nevada.</p><p>MICHAEL P. BRANCH is a professor of literature and environment at the University of Nevada, Reno, where he teaches creative nonfiction, American literature, environmental studies, and film studies. He has published five books and more than two hundred essays, articles, and reviews. Mike lives with his wife, Eryn, and daughters, Hannah Virginia and Caroline Emerson, in a passive solar home of their own design at 6,000 feet in the remote high desert of northwestern Nevada, in the ecotone where the Great Basin Desert and Sierra Nevada Mountains meet. There he writes, plays blues harmonica, drinks sour mash, curses at baseball on the radio, cuts stove wood, and walks at least 1,200 miles each year in the surrounding hills, canyons, ridges, arroyos, and playas.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy to live in the high desert of the American West&#x2014;it requires an eye for the sparest sort of natural beauty, a robust sense of humor that can help one weather the inevitable indignities and hardships that accompany life in such a landscape, and, yes, even a special class of regionally-inflected swear words.

In this compact and engrossing biography, Donald Pease reveals the evolution of Dr. Seuss's creative persona while offering an honest appraisal of his life. The book also features many of Dr. Seuss's lesser-known illustrations, including college drawings, insecticide ads, and wartime political cartoons--all of which offer a glimpse of his early artistic style and the visual origins of the more famous creatures that later populated his children's books. <br><br>As Pease traces the full arc of Dr. Seuss's prolific career, he combines close textual readings of many of Dr. Seuss's works with a unique look at their genesis to shed new light on the enduring legacy of America's favorite children's book author.<br></p><p><br><strong>Donald Pease</strong> is Professor of English, Comparative Literature, and African-American Literature at Dartmouth, the Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities, the Founding Director of the Futures of American Studies Institute at Dartmouth, and the Chair of the Dartmouth Liberal Studies Program.<br><br>"An extraordinary biography." -- <em>Anna Maria Polidori, Alfemminile</em><p></p><br>"Highly engaging and eminently readable, this short yet comprehensive biography of the author of the some of the most popular children's classics of all time is bound to be of wide interest to anyone who grew up with them and would like to know more about the life and career of the man who was Dr. Seuss." <br>-Lawrence Buell, Harvard University <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Seuss is known to millions of grateful readers of all ages, but Theodore Geisel to far fewer. But, indeed, he was a major presence in the world of literature in the twentieth century, as Donald E. Pease Jr. makes abundantly clear in this thoroughly engaging, often brilliant, biography. It's an original work of scholarship as well as a book with narrative momentum. I learned a great deal from its pages, which has sent me back to Dr. Seuss-always a good place to land." <br>-Jay Parini author of <em>The Last Station</em> <br><p></p><br>"I'm glad that so many of Donald Pease's unique and revealing insights on Dr. Seuss--observations he shared with me on camera with an effusiveness and profundity quite unmatched--have found their way into book form. No one tells these tales of young Ted, Mr. Geisel, and Dr. Seuss, and makes the connections between the three of them, quite like Dr. Pease." <br>-Ron Lamothe, producer-director of <em>The Political Dr. Seuss</em><p></p><br>"A solid addition to the literature about one of the 20th century's most influential American writers." -- <em>Kirkus</em><p></p><br>"The biography offers a succinct, thoroughly researched, and engaging introduction to one of children's literature most influential creators...The result is a smoothly integrated portrait that humanizes an American icon and will appeal to casual readers and researchers alike." -- <em>Booklist</em> <br><p></p><br>"Lively little psychobiography...Pease nimbly demonstrates that Geisel's lessons for children and adults alike are that learning need not be tedious, brilliance need not be gratuitously complex, and moral lessons can be conveyed without scolding." --<em>Daily Beast</em> <br><p></p><br>"Offering a compelling treatment that is accessible to any reader...Highly recommended." --<em>Choice</em> <br><p></p><br>"Well researched biography.

References to Five Percent language and ideas are found in the lyrics of wide-ranging artists, such as Nas, Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, and even Jay-Z.</p><p>The Five Percenters are denounced by white America as racists, and orthodox Islam as heretics, for teaching that the black man is Allah. Michael Muhammad Knight ("the Hunter S. Thompson of Islamic literature" -The Guardian) has engaged this culture as both white and Muslim; and over the course of his relationship with The Five Percenters, his personal position changed from that of an outsider to an accepted participant with his own initiatory name (Azreal Wisdom). This has given him an intimate perch from which to understand and examine the controversial doctrines of this influential movement. In <i>Why I Am a Five Percenter</i>, Knight strips away years of sensationalism to offer a serious encounter with Five Percenter thought.</p><p>Encoded within Five Percent culture is a profound critique of organized religion, from which the movement derives its name: Only Five Percent can act as "poor righteous teachers" against the evil Ten Percent, the power structure which uses religion to deceive the Eighty- Five Percent, the "deaf, dumb, and blind" masses. Questioning his own relationship to the Five Percent, Knight directly confronts the community's most difficult teachings. In <i>Why I Am a Five Percenter</i>, Knight not only illuminates a thought system that must appear bizarre to outsiders, but he also brilliantly dissects the very issues of"insiders" and "outsiders," territory and ownership, as they relate to religion and privilege, and to our conditioned ideas about race.</p></p><p><b>Michael Muhammad Knight</b> has studied Islam at a madrassa in Pakistan, the Allah School in Harlem, and Harvard University. His work has been censored, boycotted, confiscated, and threatened with legal action. This is his seventh book.</p><h2>The Culture of Theology</h2><p>John Webster, one of the world&#39;s leading systematic theologians, published extensively on the nature and practice of Christian theology. This work marked a turning point in Webster&#39;s theological development and is his most substantial statement on the task of theology. It shows why theology matters and why its pursuit is a demanding but exhilarating venture. Previously unavailable in book form, this magisterial statement, now edited and critically introduced for the first time, presents Webster&#39;s legendary lectures to a wider readership. It contains an extensive introductory essay by Ivor Davidson.</p><p>"This volume provides the reader with a wonderful and welcome chance to reflect with John Webster on the task of theology--its methods, sources, contexts, purpose, and character. The lectures presented here are redolent with the freshness, insight, and wisdom that characterize the finest theological inquiry. They leave one inspired and encouraged, yet also gloriously unsettled by the vocation of theology and its demands. Complete with an illuminating introduction by Ivor Davidson, this work comes highly recommended."<br>--<b>Paul Nimmo</b>, University of Aberdeen<br><br>"Why would a theologian as God-centered as John Webster be constantly ruminating on theology's culture, theology's tasks, Christian tradition, university faculties, and so forth? He does so in order to meet his hearers in the midst of their (our) theologically scandalous loss of interest in God and Christ and to call out: God is summoning you, the eschaton (Christ himself) has broken in among you, Scripture is speaking Christ's Word to you in the Spirit! When Christ is recognized for who he is, theology can rediscover itself for what it is: a joyful response to the risen Lord. Let theologians be Christians and thereby really have something to say to one another, to the university, and to the wider world."<br>--<b>Matthew Levering</b>, Mundelein Seminary<br><br>"This book is vintage John Webster--a stringent but also generous summons to let theology be about nothing less than God. It is the best account of what it means to be a theologian <i>existentially</i> since Karl Barth's <i>Evangelical Theology</i>. I hope it will find a wide readership in both the church and the academy."<br>--<b>Joseph Mangina</b>, Wycliffe College, Toronto School of Theology<br><br>"How wonderful to have Webster's <i>Culture of Theology</i> edited and made available to a new generation of readers in this fine book. I count myself fortunate to have had the challenge in these chapters--to strive to think of theology, its methods, aims, and practices, <i>theologically</i>--put to me during my student days and to have been compelled to wrestle continuously with the possibilities and perils of doing theology in the eschatological space created by 'the staggering good news of Jesus Christ.' This book stands as a winsome invitation to others to do the same."<br>--<b>Philip&nbsp;G. Ziegler</b>, University of Aberdeen"<i>The Culture of Theology</i> encapsulates John Webster's thinking about the task of theology at a crucial stage in his own theological development, orienting the study of theology around the living address of the gospel's God and toward the communities, conversations, and character requisite to theology's flourishing. In addition, this book exhibits many of the virtues it commends: reverent wonder before theology's divine subject matter, humble attention to the divine Word, deference to the wisdom of the communion of saints, and critical dialogue with the various conversation partners and settings of theology. For this reason <i>The Culture of Theology</i> is a welcome guide in the cultivation of theological understanding."<br>--<b>Scott&nbsp;R. Swain</b>, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando<br><b><br></b>This outstanding work offers a short account of the nature of Christian theology. In a series of six lectures, John Webster explores the privilege of thinking and speaking of God in light of "the staggering good news of Jesus Christ." How might faith approach that task? Webster proposes that we do theology well when we recognize the gospel as the most important reality. He considers the significance of church, Bible, and tradition as foundational to the unique "cultural world" the gospel brings into being, and he explores the challenges as well as the joys of inhabiting that sphere. Theology has particular responsibilities: in its academic conversations, in its self-criticism, and in its spiritual and moral life; at the heart of its calling lies prayer. Webster's exposition, here available in book form for the first time, is accompanied by an introduction by his close colleague, Ivor&nbsp;J. Davidson, who was involved in the original lecture series and discussed the material extensively with him.</p><h2>The Physics of Immortality: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead</h2><p>Is there a higher power in the universe?

Deaf since childhood, she appreciates her family&#x2019;s efforts to nurture her spirit, but the man they&#x2019;ve chosen for her betrothal can never fulfill her. The only one Emily has ever desired is bold and reckless Lord Ashley Kendrick. Her childhood amour inspired her fantasies and vowed never to forget her&#x2014;even as he left her for a new life in India and a new love.<br><br>Seven years and countless dreams later, Ashley has returned a desolate widower to Bowden Abbey and, true to his promise, to Emily. Yet his heedless proposal of marriage has left her unexpectedly conflicted. Though the heat of passion still burns, Emily fears that it&#x2019;s only a sense of duty&#x2014;not love&#x2014;that has brought him to bended knee. And what is she to make of those seven lost years clouded in secrets too dark for Ashley to share?<br><br>For Emily, her greatest and only love now becomes one worth fighting for, one of startling revelations and second chances, and one, like a melody, too beautiful for words....</p><p>Once again Mary Balogh has written a poignant romance that will be long remembered for its originality and great beauty. In this unusual story, Lady Emily has been deaf and mute since early childhood. She has been cared for and is well loved by a family who nurtures her independence and doesn&#39;t make her feel inadequate because of her disability. Because Emmy&#39;s sister and brother-in-law want her to experience life to its fullest, they assist her in finding a good marriage partner. But Emmy wants to marry for love; she doesn&#39;t want to be a beautiful silent partner to a man who doesn&#39;t care to know who she really is.

Below are some highlights of what is included in &#x2018;your' basic use of force class:</p><p>SECTION 1. TRAINING. I explain policy and laws that officers are taught. We examine use of force, how to define a threat, and the difference between excessive force and unnecessary force. </p><p>SECTION 2. CHECKS AND BALANCES. This section explains how an officer's decisions are examined if suspected of being bad decisions.</p><p>SECTION 3. EXPERIENCE. We explore how officers see the world that they live in.

Sometimes a decision will change the lives of everyone involved&#x2015;forever.</p><p>SECTION 4. ABOUT YOU. Review what you should have learned. Why does community action fail? What is it that can really be done? Know how to behave when faced by an officer.

With her Muslim hijab and down-turned gaze, Najwa is invisible to most eyes, especially to the rich families whose houses she cleans in London. Twenty years ago, Najwa, then at university in Khartoum, would never have imagined that one day she would be a maid. An upper-class Westernized Sudanese, her dreams were to marry well and raise a family. But a coup forces the young woman and her family into political exile in London. Soon orphaned, she finds solace and companionship within the Muslim community. Then Najwa meets Tamer, the intense, lonely younger brother of her employer. They find a common bond in faith and slowly, silently, begin to fall in love. Written with directness and force, <i>Minaret</i> is a lyric and insightful novel about Islam and an alluring glimpse into a culture Westerners are only just beginning to understand.</p><p>Leila Aboulela was born in 1964 and grew up in Khartoum. She is the author of two books: a novel, The Translator which was published to critical acclaim in 1999 and a book of short stories, Coloured Lights published in 2000. Leila Aboulela lives between Djakarta and Aberdeen.Adult/High School&#x2013;The daughter of a wealthy government official, Najwa grows up pampered and carefree in western Sudan during the 1980s. With her 19th birthday, though, comes the overthrow of the president and arrest of her father by the new government. Najwa; her twin brother, Omar; and their mother flee to London. Within a few years, she is completely alone: her father has been executed, her mother succumbs to a fatal illness, and Omar is in prison for an assault conviction stemming from his drug abuse. Once a fashionable university student in Khartoum, the young woman makes ends meet as a nanny to a wealthy Arab family. Clothed in traditional Muslim hijab, she has suddenly become invisible within the city, much as the Ethiopian servants used to blend into the background in her parents household. Yet even as she comes to terms with this anonymity, a spark develops between her and the younger brother of her employer, and she is forced to confront the chasm between servant and master. Aboulela offers a captivating glimpse into one womans journey through the various strata of society. The protagonists experiences give her a deeper reliance on her faith and help her to recognize the shallowness of the life she left behind. This is the authors first work to be published in the U.S. Students will appreciate the story not only for its insights into Muslim faith and traditions, but also for the ways her compellingly real characters relate to one another.<i>&#x2013;Kim Dare, Fairfax County Public Library System, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Instead he asks, "How can the death and resurrection of a Jewish rabbi of the first century . . . be <em>the</em> decisive event in the history of humanity, the hinge and crux and crossroads for <em>everything</em>?" With the question reframed for the wide screen, Leithart pursues the cultural and public settings and consequences of the cross and resurrection. He writes, "I hope to show that atonement theology <em>must</em> be social theory if it is going to have any coherence, relevance or comprehensibility at all." There are no small thoughts or cramped plot lines in this vision of the deep-down things of cross and culture. While much is recognizable as biblical theology projected along Pauline vectors, Leithart marshals a stunning array of discourse to crack open one of the big questions of Christian theology. This is a book on the atonement that eludes conventional categories, prods our theological imaginations and is sure to spark conversation and debate.</p><p>Peter J. Leithart (PhD, University of Cambridge) is president of Theopolis Institute and an adjunct senior fellow of theology at New Saint Andrews College in Moscow, Idaho. He is the author of many books including <em>Defending Constantine</em>,"Peter Leithart is one of our best and most creative theologians. In this wide-ranging book Leithart shows that doctrine is not some abstract entity disconnected from contemporary life but is in fact deeply relevant and pregnant with social and political insights. Leithart is biblically, theologically and culturally literate&#x2015;a rare combination&#x2015;and thus able to produce the sort of work we so badly need today. Attending to the doctrines of the atonement and justification, he writes in the best tradition of apologetics, namely that of creative, orthodox, contextual theology." (Craig Bartholomew, professor of philosophy and religion and theology, Redeemer University College)<br><br>"Among contemporary theologians, only Leithart has the biblical erudition, theological breadth and rhetorical power necessary for writing a book like this one. His Christian creativity and love for Jesus Christ jump off the page. As an account of atonement, this book is also an account of the entirety of Christian reality, and indeed of the reality of Israel as well, in light of pagan and secular cultures and in light of the church's own failures to live what Christ has given. At its heart is an urgent call for all Christians, living in the Spirit, to share the Eucharist together against every fleshly barrier and Spirit-less form of exclusion. Leithart's dazzling biblical and ecumenical manifesto merits the closest attention and engagement." (Matthew Levering, Perry Family Foundation Professor of Theology, Mundelein Seminary)<br><br>"When you read Peter Leithart, you suddenly realize how timid most Christian theologians are, tepidly offering us a few 'insights' to edify our comfort with the status quo. Leithart is like a lightning strike from a more ancient, more courageous Christian past, his flaming pen fueled by biblical acuity and scholarly rigor. In this book, he does it again&#x2015;here is the <em>City of God</em> written afresh for our age, asking a question you didn't know to ask but now can't avoid: Why is the cross the center of human history? Couldn't God have found another way? Leithart's answer&#x2015;this book&#x2015;is a monumental achievement." (James K. A. Smith, professor of philosophy, Calvin College, editor, Comment magazine)<br><br>"I have benefitted greatly from Leithart's work. It was a work immersed in the Scriptures and also sensitive to contemporary concerns. . . . I see Leithart's work as a creative ecumenical proposal that can serve as a starting point to bridge the East and the West. In an age where the rhetoric of unity becomes cheapened by division and violence, Leithart advance a program where fleshy structures of exclusion and division are abolished.

In the seas of northern Europe, the small coastal village of Elasund falls prey to marauding neighbors. Their food stores pillaged, women and children stolen, livestock destroyed, the villagers are left to barely survive the harsh winter &#x2014; and contemplate a drastic solution to their recurring hardships: leaving the only village they have ever known. Foster brothers Candamir and Osmund lead their people on an epic quest to a mythic island home, but without knowledge of exactly where the island is, they must trust the gods to deliver them safely. Lost at sea and set adrift, an extraordinarily violent storm washes them ashore the island famed in pagan lore: Catan. They quickly set about building a new society but old grudges, animosities, and social orders lead to fraternal strife. As the ideals of Candamir&#x2019;s Christian slave spread throughout the village and conflict with pagan law, the two belief systems clash. When both Osmund and Candamir fall in love with Siglind, the mysterious queen of the Cold Islands, things come to a head. <br><br>Based on the wildly popular board game of the same name designed by Klaus Teuber, Rebecca Gable&#x2019;s <em>The Settlers of Catan</em> is a must-read adventure rich in detail and rippling with intensity.</p><p><strong>Interview: Author Rebecca Gable &amp; Settlers of Catan Creator Klaus Teuber </strong><br> <strong><br>Klaus Teuber:</strong> When we saw each other at the Frankfurt Book Fair recently, I recalled how we met there 10 years ago. Do you remember? <p><strong>Rebecca Gable:</strong> Of course! You asked if I could imagine writing a novel based on your famous board game.</p> <p><strong>KT:</strong> I had read one of your books and was so excited about it, I wanted you to bring the story of the settlement of Catan to life. What was your first thought when I asked you?</p> <p><strong>RG:</strong> I thought, "This must be the most unusual and fascinating project ever proposed to me." What gave you the idea for a novelization in the first place?</p> <p><strong>KT:</strong> In the game, seafarers land on Catan. They harvest, trade, build, and settle the island. But where did those seafarers come from? Who are they? Why did they undertake this dangerous journey? The game doesn't answer any of those questions. I had some ideas but no story yet. Then you entered the picture.</p> <p><strong>RG:</strong> We met in Cologne to discuss some basic plot ideas, and it turned out we both had the word "Vikings" in our heads. What is so "Viking" about the game?</p> <p><strong>KT:</strong> Catan is set in the Early Middle Ages, and at that time the Vikings were the only seafaring people to venture into the open ocean, and therefore the only ones capable of reaching a fictitious island in the middle of the Atlantic. That was probably at the back of our minds. <br></p> <p>How do you move from a draft outline like ours to developing your characters? Do you use people you know as models?</p> <p><strong>RG:</strong> Never. I'm fond of my friends and want to keep them, so I make sure the characters in my books don't resemble them. Speaking of characters: If you had to choose, would you rather sit down in a beer garden with Candamir or Osmund?</p> <p><strong>KT:</strong> Well, I'd prefer a little flirt with Siglind. But if I may only choose one of the men, I'd like Candamir to explain to me how to build a nice wooden chest. I still need a Christmas present for my wife.</p> <p>How did you come up with the idea to season the novel with Austin, a likeable character who so insistently (and unsuccessfully) tries to evangelize his master, Candamir?</p> <p><strong>RG:</strong> The game inspired the creation of Austin. You've got to be clever and sometimes mean to win at Settlers of Catan, but whenever I play, it strikes me that what you need most is the ability to cooperate and compromise. Austin stands for that ability, I think--though he can be clever and mean, too.</p> <p><strong>KT:</strong> In your telling of the legend of Catan, the god Odin falls in love with Tanuri, the king of the Albs' daughter. Normally Odin can have any woman, but Tanuri makes a fool of him when he creates an idyllic island for her. Grief stricken, he moves the island to a place where nobody can find it. Of course, the island is Catan. Where did you get this wonderful idea? Did it come from an archetype in Norse mythology?</p> <p><strong>RG:</strong> It's not based on any particular Norse saga, but I tried to capture the atmosphere and narrative patterns of the form. I also wanted to emphasize how very special Catan is--not just in the book, but for millions of fans all over the world who love the game. Catan is a mythical and wonderful place.</p>Rebecca Gable is a best-selling author of historical fiction and crime novels in Germany.

A great deal of theological study has focused on the Jewish cultural and religious context of his life and ministry. It is only natural that this attention should lead us to a new approach to his mother, Mary of Nazareth. To some extent, this quest for the Jewish Mary involves excavating beneath centuries of devotional reflection and artistic depictions that have presented a mythologized Mary, detached from history and from her specific Jewish identity. In this book, Mary Christine Athans draws on the latest historical research, the fruits of post-Vatican II Jewish-Christian dialogue, the insights of feminist theology, and contemporary spiritual reflection to rediscover the Jewish Mary a woman of enormous courage, strength, and prayer. In restoring Mary to her own time and place, she helps us rediscover Mary s message for our own time.</p><p>Mary Christine Athans, BVM is a Sister of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, professor emerita at the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity of the University of St. Thomas (Minnesota) and currently adjunct faculty at Loyola University Chicago and the Catholic Theological Union.This attractive series aimed at equine enthusiasts highlights similarities and differences among popular breeds.

You'll find out how temperature impacts your enjoyment of the dishes you make as does color, alcohol, and more. The handbook goes beyond telling home cooks what ingredients go well together or explaining cooking ratios. You'll learn how to adjust a dish that's too salty or too acidic and how to determine when something might be lacking. It also includes recipes and simple kitchen experiments that illustrate the importance of salt in a dish, or identifies whether you're a "supertaster" or not. Each recipe and experiment highlights the chapter's main lesson. <i>How to Taste</i> will ultimately help you feel confident about why and how various components of a dish are used to create balance, harmony, and deliciousness.</p><p>When she's not squid jigging, fishing, or cavorting through the woods picking wild things for her next meal, BECKY SELENGUT is a private chef, author, humorist, and cooking teacher.

M. Stirling</b> is the author of many science fiction and fantasy novels. A former lawyer and an amateur historian, he lives with his wife, Jan.CHAPTER ONE<br><br> Hilo <br>Capital City, Aupuni o Hawaii <br>(Kingdom of Hawaii) <br>November 26th <br> Change Year 46/2044 AD<br><br> Crown Princess�rlaith Arminger Mackenzie looked south and shoreward towards the Hawaiian capital of Hilo, shading her eyes with a hand. The planks beneath her feet were the quarterdeck of the frigate RMN <i>Sea-Leopard</i>, pride of the Royal Montivallan Navy and new-built in the Astoria yards; eighteen hundred tons of Douglas fir and Garry oak and Sitka spruce, cordage and sailcloth and copper sheathing and brass and steel salvaged from the dead cities, at nearly three hundred feet from bowsprit to rudder the most powerful warship afloat in the Pacific.<br><br> It had also been packed to the gunwales with double its normal complement on the trip across from Montival, nearly seven hundred souls, since there weren't enough transports to spare the warships. The <i>Sea-Leopard</i> wasn't as busy or as crowded now: the sails on the three towering masts were furled as she lay at anchor, and all the extra personnel plus the liberty party were ashore. Most were members of the crowd whose surf-murmur carried over the thousand yards or so to the docks, apart from the ones whose main ambition on dry land was to find a bottle and go from upright and sober to horizontal and unconscious with the least possible interval in between.<br><br> A<i>fter this trip I find that a wee bit attractive</i>, �rlaith thought dryly. <i>Sure and it would be the more so if I'd been sleeping in a hammock in the hold with two inches' space on either side and someone on a pallet on the deck below and nobody washing much for that there's not enough fresh water for anything but drinking. Even the rats are probably swimming for it.</i><br><br> She'd been in a bunk in the Captain's cabin, sharing the space with the Admiral and six others, and had gotten admiring looks for not taking the whole for herself. Now everything on board was squared away and shipshape, down to the neat coils of cable and hawser, and the pyramids of roundshot and racks of bolt next to the long rows of massive catapults on the gun-deck below. There had been a good deal of coming and going by everyone except �rlaith herself; her setting foot on Hawaiian soil was a political matter, and had to be staged with due ceremony.<br><br> Shore leave or no, the <i>Sea-Leopard</i> could still be ready to sail and fight in the very short time it took the topmast hands to run up the ratlines and reach the gaskets on the sails; the catapults would be cocked and loaded by then and the anchors cast off with empty casks to float the ends of their cables for later attention. The Montivallans were among friends . . . but it never hurt to be ready.<br><br> Admiral Naysmith had been standing with her hands clasped behind her back, hard-featured square face with the little blue burn-mark of the Bearkiller A-List between her brows impassive above the white linen tropical-service uniform jacket and gold-braided epaulettes. Now she nodded at the signal-flag that went up a mast rigged on the dock ashore and turned to the ship's captain.<br><br> "We're ready to proceed, Mr. Edwards," she said. "Make it so. And a signal to that effect to the Japanese flagship, in the Crown Princess' name."<br><br> Naysmith cocked an eye at �rlaith, who nodded approval. The orders ran down the chain of command, more and more specific as they did. Signal-flags of their own went up the halyard to the mizzen-peak. �rlaith politely ignored the exchange, studying the town instead; she liked and respected the blunt-spoken Bearkiller's professionalism but they weren't close, and she was careful not to infringe on her area of authority. As overall commander of the expedition�rlaith was entitled to tell her what she wanted to accomplish, but how to do it was the Admiral's business.<br><br> She <i>suspected</i> that the middle-aged Naysmith had doubts about someone of the same twenty-two years as her own eldest child-who was a lieutenant somewhere in the fleet-being in charge of a major expedition, bearer of the royal Sword or no, though of course she'd never say a word to that effect. Looking at it from the outside she had something of a point. �rlaith had grown up watching famously good strategists in action, but she knew she wasn't equal to either of her parents.<br><br> <i>Yet. And they started as young as I am now, overshadowed by their famous parents . . . two of whom . . .</i><br><br> Her maternal and paternal grandfathers had been deadly enemies from the Change on and had ended up killing each other in single combat with several thousand witnesses in their respective armies whooping them on.<br><br> <i>Ah, well, youth is the one disease age always cures . . . and we of House Artos are not a long-lived breed, anyway . . . and besides, it's an interesting view. It's my first time off the mainland, even if I'm not traveling just for the pleasure of it.</i><br><br> Hilo was a very substantial if not huge city of more than twenty thousand souls, low-built and spread out amid trees and greenery and gardens ornamental or practical or both. White walls and roofs of tile or palm-thatch showed through the greenery and even at this distance you could see the purple and blue and crimson of banks of flowers and blossoming trees, citrus and tropical fruits, jacarandas and flamboyants and flame trees.<br><br> Southward loomed the peaks of massive mountains, not steep but very high; snow glittered from the tops of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. The sight made the hair prickle on the back of her neck, and she felt a return of that sense . . . a feeling of chambers within her mind opening . . . that she'd felt when she first took up the Sword of the Lady after her father's death. Her hand went to the crystal pommel at her side, the symbol of the High Kingship that Rudi Mackenzie-not yet Artos the First, High King of Montival-had won on the Quest of the Sunrise Lands. In form it was a knight's longsword, save that the guard was shaped like a crescent moon rather than a cross, and the pommel at the end of the double-lobed horn-and-silver hilt was moon-colored crystal cradled in a stag's antlers rather than a metal ball.<br><br> Beneath that seeming . . . it could be and do many things, and you could never entirely disregard the sheer presence of it even when it was quiescent. She'd often thought that it wasn't really a thing of matter as most understood such things, but a thought in the mind of the Goddess made manifest in the world of common day.<br><br> Now it let her sense . . .<br><br> <i>That's sacredness</i>, she thought.<br><br> She inclined her head towards the peaks of the volcanoes and made the Old Faith's gesture of reverence with the back of her hand to her forehead.<br><br> As she did, images flashed through her mind: a great canoe's prow grinding ashore on a beach of blinding white sand, its grotesquely carved figurehead alive somehow; a giant figure roaring in mirth as he wrestled with a huge eight-eyed bat; a man of stern kingly majesty raising a carved staff as his black hair blew around a tattooed face and the sea broke at his feet in a storm of terrible power; a woman of unbearable beauty whose eyes were the fires at the core of Earth, walking atop the surface of a river that ran with molten stone . . .<br><br> But a sacredness that is not mine. Not hostile and not bad, but Powers fierce and wild and strong and . . . foreign. Stories I haven't heard, walking the ridge of the world once more. The Change opened many doors, and the world is very wide.<br><br> The warm moist air from the shore fluttered her long hair beneath its plumed Scots bonnet, locks yellow-gold with a slight hint of copper. It bore scents from the land, some homely enough from cooking and people, others spicy and sweet and wild, welcome amid the usual war-fleet smells of tar and smoke, bilgewater and imperfectly clean sailors and troops packed in too tightly and rancid canola-oil smeared on armor and blades against the corrosive salt of the sea-spray.<br><br> And the overpowering stink of the horse-transports, which was like a badly-kept stable on a huge scale no matter how many times the bilges were flooded and the animals were put to work on treadmills pumping them out. Rank gave her a bubble of space on the warship to enjoy the contrast.<br><br> Some of Hilo's buildings were from before the Change, though none of the really tall ones you still saw now and then on the mainland, even in living cities like Boise or Portland. Those had probably been dismantled for their metal and glass, since without artificial ventilation and cooling they'd be even less practical in this climate than at home. More were new, and the great stepped stone platform in the middle distance was just finished, judging by the remains of bamboo scaffolding and hoisting cranes still being taken down. That was a heiau, a temple to the Gods who were worshipped here once more.<br><br> Unlike all of the cities and many of the duns and towns and steadings she knew at home there was no encompassing defensive wall to make a sharp distinction between dense-built settlement and open countryside, despite the obvious technical capacity to build one. The plots around buildings just got bigger, until you could say they were small farms and country villas rather than houses with gardens, and they started to include pastures for cattle and horses and runs for swine.<br><br> <i>Which means they haven't had war here lately, probably not since right after the Change; not great wars with massed armies and strong siege-trains, at least,</i> �rlaith thought. <i>Lucky them!</i><br><br> There had been little peace in what was Montival-to-be until her parents and their comrades had brought the High Kingdom's order with the Sword of the Lady. She had grown up among the veterans who'd fought the long grim death-grapple of the Prophet's War across half a continent, starting with her parents, and there had been the wars against the Association before that in the time of her great, wicked maternal grandfather. Her generation had lived in a spreading peace, but the memories remained.<br><br> The most familiar single sight was a massive modern fort on the peninsula to the westward where the maps of the ancient world showed a golf course, not much different save in details and decoration from the castles in the northern parts of Montival. An orca-shaped observation balloon hung high in the air above it, tethered by a long curve of cable.<br><br> <i>Form follows function,</i> she thought. <i>Everyone makes their wheels round and everyone puts a pointy stabby thing on the end of a spear.</i><br><br> The towers there flew the bright striped flag of the <i>Aupuni Mo�o Hawaii</i>, and as a courtesy the green-silver-gold banner of the High Kingdom of Montival and the <i>Hinomaru</i> of Japan.<br><br>�rlaith knew that the kingdoms of Hawaii and Montival had been friendly as long as they'd been aware of each other's existence. Since not long before her father Rudi Mackenzie's accession-as Artos the First-in the year of her birth, in fact. There had been a king again in Hawaii well before that; since right after the Change, as folk turned to ancient things as an anchor in a world gone mad. Their current ruler, Kalakaua II, was his grandson and only a few years older than�rlaith.<br><br> But that friendliness had been confined to good wishes, resident merchants who doubled as ambassadors, growing trade and a little cooperation against the pirates and raiders who grew right along with the traffic they preyed on. Just exchanging messages at this distance was hard and slow, despite a more or less common language, and the chances of misunderstanding vast.<br><br> It was a good sign that the vanguard of the fleet and army of Montival-frigates, smaller warships, scores of merchantmen turned troop-transports-had been welcomed within the long curving breakwater that guarded Hilo's harbor. Many were already tied up at the wharfs, and boats and barges plied busily back and forth to the others. And there was other shipping here too, dozens of hulls and a forest of masts, the Royal Navy of Hawaii and traders from here and around the world and others down to little fishing boats and outrigger canoes, all amid the raucous swarm of gulls and seabirds that marked a rich port.<br><br> "I wish we had more troops ashore," her liege knight-and aide-de-camp and Head of Household and childhood friend-Heuradys d'Ath grumbled beside her.<br><br> Heuradys was trying to look everywhere at once without being obvious about it and preparing to be even more overburdened ashore, with the mixture of irritation and slightly self-mocking amusement of a hyper-competent person in a position where they knew full well no amount of competence could ever be enough. In a sense it was easier for�rlaith to ignore the prospect of assassins popping up with daggers in their teeth-or waiting with concealed crossbows and poison darts-than it was for those around her. All she had to fear was death; they had the much stronger terror of living long enough to know they'd failed in their duty.<br><br> <i>After all, the Crone comes for us all, soon or late</i>, she thought. <i>I don't expect to make old bones myself, even if the Powers haven't warned me about it the way they did Da. Either I'll have children by then to take up the Sword, or one of the sibs will.</i><br><br> Then she went on aloud: "We've got thousands of troops ashore," she pointed out cheerfully. "And glad to be out of the transports they are. The horses especially, poor things. We'd have lost half or better if we couldn't stop here to let them pasture and run, and the survivors would have been useless for weeks on the other side."<br><br> Heuradys snorted. "To clarify: more troops besides the ones in their shirtsleeves seeing the sights . . . and chatting up the better-looking locals . . . and trying to eat bananas without knowing how to peel them . . . and sucking rum out of coconuts in the shade of the palms . . . and frolicking on the beaches."<br><br> "The beaches are wonderful here. <i>And</i> the oceans. The levies deserve some time off after the voyage. Fair winds and a quick passage, but it was hard sailing at times. Four hundred cases of seasickness at the same time . . ."<br><br> "Seawater warm enough to swim in! Athana witness, that's just not right, proper or natural."<br><br> "You just want some company for your ironclad misery, Herry," the Crown Princess said with a smile.</p><h2>75 Short Masterpieces</h2><p>The seventy-five short masterpieces of fiction in this volume represent the finest accomplishments in a difficult and special art form. Each creates a microcosm in which the very compactness of the story gives it power and emotional impact much more dramatic than could have been achieved in a longer or more explicit work.<br><br><i>Proof Positive</i>&nbsp;by Graham Greene in spine-chilling, Leo Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>The Three Hermits </i>has a beauty which is moving and spiritual, John Collier&#x2019;s <i>The Chaser </i>is shocking and hilarious. Selected from the literature of the world, and including writers from Boccaccio through Sylvia Townsend Warner, this volume is a classic anthology of great stories.</p><p></p><h2>A Model for Marriage: Covenant, Grace, Empowerment and Intimacy</h2><p>Jack and Judy Balswick offer a vision of marriage that is both profoundly spiritual and thoroughly practical. Drawing insight from Christian theology and from social science research, the Balswicks bring together their years of teaching, writing and being married to each other to produce a book of faith and wisdom for facing the challenge of marriage in the twenty-first century.</p><p><strong>Jack O. Balswick</strong> (Ph.D., University of Iowa) is both professor of sociology and family development, and director of marriage and family research at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He has been associate editor of the <em>Journal of Family Issues</em> since 1982. He is author or coauthor of several books, including <em>Men at the Crossroads, The Gift of Gender</em> and <em>Authentic Human Sexuality.</em>"This book on families is saturated with the wisdom gained from more than three decades of writing, teaching and counseling. The Balswicks' understanding of family dynamics is deeply shaped by their relational theological convictions. The writing is accessible; the insights are profound." (Al Dueck, The Evelyn and Frank Freed Chair for the Integration of Psychology and Theology, Fuller Theological Seminary School of Psychology)<br><br>"As a couples therapist, I get to see the empowerment of the Balswicks' differentiation-based understanding of marriage up close in the lives of couples. No one has articulated a better Christian model for the growth-producing challenges of contemporary marriage. Their rich practical integration of social science, theology and spirituality makes this book highly unique among the stacks of books on marriage. I am eager to recommend this book to clients, counselors and therapists." (Steven J. Sandage, Ph.D., LP, Associate Professor of Marriage and Family Studies, Bethel University)<br><br>"The Balswicks have given us yet another great resource in the quest to understand just how Christian marriage is <em>Christian.</em> This volume is a premier example of how theology should inform our work as marriage counselors. Readers will be enriched as they learn from the authors how the biblical concepts of covenant, grace, empowerment and intimacy should govern our conduct in marriage." (James R. Beck, Ph.D., Senior Professor of Counseling, Denver Seminary, Li2271ttleton, Colorado)<br><br>"In these times of confusion about what marriage is and does, or even if it should exist at all, a refreshingly clear and biblically precise reminder of what God intended for marriage is most welcome. Not only do Drs. Jack and Judy Balswick offer a sound theology of marriage, but the trinitarian model on which it is based leads naturally into practical guidance for couples on how to build a godly marriage.<br><br> The book is 'state of the art,' yet it takes couples through very practical topics such as differentiation, communication, conflict resolution and also the seasons of marriage. It is a helpful resource for couples at any stage of marriage, and at the same time provides an excellent resource and textbook for colleges and seminaries.<br><br> I predict that this book will be around for a long time; it is timeless!" (Archibald D. Hart, Ph.D., FPPR, Senior Professor of Psychology and Dean Emeritus, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California)</p><h2>On the Art of the Cinema</h2><p>In his preface the author states: &#x201c;The cinema is now one of the main objects on which efforts should be concentrated in order to conduct the revolution in art and literature. The cinema occupies an important place in the overall development of art and literature. As such it is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolution and construction. Therefore, concentrating efforts on the cinema, making breakthroughs and following up success in all areas of art and literature is the basic principle that we must adhere to in revolutionizing art and literature.&#x201d; <p>Kim Jong Il (1942- ) is leader of North Korea (1994- ).

This volume brings together the best of his three out-of-print works on the subject: &#39;On Drink&#39;, &#39;Every Day Drinking&#39; and &#39;How&#39;s Your Glass?&#39;.</p><p>Born in London in 1922, Kingsley Amis was one of the best-loved British novelists of the twentieth century. He was the author of more than twenty novels, including the classic Lucky Jim, and a number of other works of criticism, poetry, and memoir. He was knighted in 1990, and died in 1995 at the age of seventy-three.The drinks revival is nearly complete&#x2014;it&#x2019;s now possible to be as insufferable about beer and spirits as about wine&#x2014;but the revival seems to come with a warning label: enjoy the drinks, but don&#x2019;t drink too much. In the face of that, it&#x2019;s refreshing to see an artifact from a more hedonistic era: Amis knew the finer points of booze as well as anyone, but he never apologized for enjoying its effect, either. This reissue, appropriately introduced by Christopher Hitchens, collects Amis&#x2019; three drinks books: On Drink (1973), an indispensable primer; Every Day Drinking (1983), a browseworthy collection of newspaper columns; and How&#x2019;s Your Glass?

The bonds we form are often the source that drives us to helping professionals like therapists and pastors in the first place. And yet, it is from these relation�ships that our greatest moments of healing spring. Recogniz�ing the value of relationships, pastors and therapists have been leading small therapeutic groups for years. Yet few lead�ers have a specific, easy-to-follow, and researched framework to structure their groups.<br><i>Helping Groups Heal </i>presents &#x201c;The Healing Cycle,&#x201d; a grace-based model that facilitates healing and growth in groups. It has been tested with a variety of settings, and can be adapted to nearly any small group, from sex addiction therapy to marriage therapy to Bible studies.<br> The basic components of &#x201c;The Healing Cycle&#x201d; are grace, safety, vulnerability, truth, ownership, and confession. <i>Helping Groups Heal </i>guides the reader through these elements, offering case studies and practical advice from the voices of researchers and practitioners. Each chapter shows how &#x201c;The Healing Cycle&#x201d; moves its members to share their truth, own it, and make positive change in their lives. Each step of the process allows participants to move past surface issues and find depth in their understanding of their pain.<br> Whether you have been leading small groups for years or are about to lead your first session, <i>Helping Groups Heal </i>is an accessible, easy-to-follow guide through &#x201c;The Healing Cycle&#x201d; that will give each group member what&#x2019;s needed to grow, relate, and heal.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Jan Paul Hook, EdD</b> is a licensed clinical professional counselor (LCPC) in the state of Illinois.

There is great potential&nbsp;for small groups to be a context for group members to&nbsp;experience healing and growth, but leading a small group isn&#x2019;t&nbsp;easy. To make matters worse, sometimes group leaders step into&nbsp;their role without much knowledge or training for how to be an&nbsp;effective leader. Without a baseline set of skills and tools, small&nbsp;group leaders often struggle.<br><br> This book is designed to help small group leaders develop&nbsp;basic and advanced skills to create a group context in which&nbsp;members can experience healing and growth.

What, if anything, links Ozu&#x2019;s sparse portraits of domestic life and the colorful worlds of anime? In <i>What Is Japanese Cinema?</i> Yomota Inuhiko provides a concise and lively history of Japanese film that shows how cinema tells the story of Japan&#x2019;s modern age.<br><br>Discussing popular works alongside auteurist masterpieces, Yomota considers films in light of both Japanese cultural particularities and cinema as a worldwide art form. He covers the history of Japanese film from the silent era to the rise of J-Horror in its historical, technological, and global contexts. Yomota shows how Japanese film has been shaped by traditonal art forms such as kabuki theater as well as foreign influences spanning Hollywood and Italian neorealism. Along the way, he considers the first golden age of Japanese film; colonial filmmaking in Korea, Manchuria, and Taiwan; the impact of World War II and the U.S. occupation; the Japanese film industry&#x2019;s rise to international prominence during the 1950s and 1960s; and the challenges and technological shifts of recent decades. Alongside a larger thematic discussion of what defines and characterizes Japanese film, Yomota provides insightful readings of canonical directors including Kurosawa, Ozu, Suzuki, and Miyazaki as well as genre movies, documentaries, indie film, and pornography. An incisive and opinionated history, <i>What Is Japanese Cinema?</i> is essential reading for admirers and students of Japan&#x2019;s contributions to the world of film.</p><p>Yomota Inuhiko is an acclaimed Japanese essayist, cultural critic, and poet, the author of dozens of books on a wide range of subjects. He taught film studies and comparative literature at Meiji Gakuin University.<br><br>Philip Kaffen is an assistant professor in the Department of Languages and Culture Studies at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.A compact, breezy, and stimulating summary of Japanese film history. . . . Yomota's book offers something largely absent from English-language writing about Japanese cinema: a Japanese perspective. (Kazu Watanabe <i>Film Comment</i>)<br><br>No living scholar-critic of Japanese movies possesses Yomota Inuhiko's encyclopedic range and sheer passion for film. <i>What Is Japanese Cinema?</i> is a tour de force of filmic history: a concise and spirited account of how Japanese film came to be, illuminating carryovers from native theatrical traditions and the tensions lining the political history of modern East Asia. That Japanese cinema has all along been local, and&#x2015;in its imperial ambitions, aesthetic power, or moral force&#x2015;global in its reach, is a matter that this insightful book brings remarkably to light. (Paul Anderer, author of <i>Kurosawa's Rashomon: A Vanished City, a Lost Brother, and the Voice Inside His Iconic Films</i>)<br><br>A famously rambunctious critic, Inuhiko Yomota proves to be an even better pedagogue. He deftly organizes Japan&#x2019;s kaleidoscopic genres and film fashions into a totality you can grasp. Auteurs and stars sparkle above an omnivorous industry that metabolized traditional theater, popular manga, and Hollywood techniques into unmistakably Japanese forms. A swift, truly satisfying summary, <i>What Is Japanese Cinema?</i> is also just as vibrant and searching as its title, because its author is clearly in the thrall of his marvelous subject. (Dudley Andrew, Yale University)<br><br><i>What Is Japanese Cinema? </i>goes beyond the auteurist criticism that tells a history of cinema as a compilation of masterpieces. Instead, the work locates cinema in the specific contexts of cultural history as well as technological history. Yomota Inuhiko's knowledge of and attentiveness to film theories and histories is incredible.

In the article he detailed several of the books held in a portion of Hitler&#39;s library at Brown University. Mr. Ryback also mentioned some of the passages Hitler marked in these books. One particular passage was worthy of attention: &#34;He who does not carry demonic seeds within him will never give birth to a new world.&#34; That passage appeared in the book &#34;Magic: History / Theory / Practice&#34;, written by Dr. Ernst Schertel. Schertel was a researcher of alternative sexual practices, nudism, and the occult. After finishing his book Magic in 1923 he sent a dedicated copy to Adolf Hitler.

Learning how to cast a circle, work magick, compile a Book of Shadows, and honor the God and Goddess on esbats and sabbats can be exhilarating. But once you've mastered the basics of Witchcraft comes the real challenge of living your faith every moment of every day. Living as a Witch is knowing that <em>you</em> are the magick.</p> <p><em>Advanced Witchcraft</em> doesn't contain any "Wicca 101" information&#x2015;it assumes that you're already familiar with the nuts and bolts of the Craft. Instead, this book challenges you to think critically about your beliefs and practices, what they mean to you, how they've changed, and where you're going. Along the way you'll also learn many techniques for intermediate and advanced Witches, including:</p> <ul> <li>Meeting your shadow</li> <li>Advanced warding and psychic self-defense</li> <li>Power animals, familiars, and shapeshifters</li> <li>Working the labyrinth and the maze</li> <li>Advanced tree spirituality</li> <li>Advanced augury and divination</li> <li>Magick and ritual using the fine arts of storytelling, dance, music, art, and drama</li> <li>The art of Wishcraft</li> <li>Spirits and lost souls</li> <li>Banishing and closing portals</li> <li>The healing arts</li> </ul></p><p><p>Edain became a self-initiated Witch in 1981 and was an active part of the Pagan community since her formal initiation into a large San Antonio coven in 1983. Edain had researched alternative spiritualities since her teens, when she was first introduced to Kabbalah. Since that time, she studied a variety of magickal paths, including Celtic, Appalachian folk magick, and Curanderismo, a Mexican-American folk tradition.</p> <p>An alumnus of the University of Texas with a BA in history, she was affiliated with several professional writer's organizations and occasionally presented workshops on magickal topics or worked individually with students who wished to study Witchcraft.</p> <p>Edain was the author of over fifteen books, including <em>Bewitchments</em>, <em>Enchantments</em>, and <em>Ostara: Customs, Spells &amp; Rituals for the Rites of Spring</em>.</p>The Advanced Witch <br>and the Craft <br> <br>In the beginning of your journey into the many worlds of Witchcraft, you <br>probably looked upon the Witches who were teaching you with some measure of awe. <br> <br>You were just embarking on a journey they had enjoyed time and again, and everything they said or did fascinated you. Like a sponge in the Sahara, you just couldn't soak up enough water from the well of knowledge they had to offer. You may even have embarrassed a few of your teachers with your adoration because their vast experience made them seem so competent, so knowledgeable, and so holy that you almost confused them with your own spiritual goals. <br> <br>Then, to your ultimate confusion, you discovered that even the most elder among them still considered himself to be a humble student of the Craft, a servant of his patron deities, and a friend to the elements rather than their master. He might have had more experience than you, but he never claimed to be better. If he was the right kind of teacher, he refused to be idolized and he never talked down to you. No question you wanted to ask was too silly or so simple that he wouldn't give it serious thought and an <br>honest reply-even if that reply was "I don't know." <br> <br>He may have surprised you even more by referring to you as <i>his </i>teacher.What a head rush! It was as if the world had just turned inside out and everyone was now upside down. There was so much information to be filed in your mind, so many myths to hear, so many related areas to explore, so many exciting ideas to dissect, and you wanted to do them all at once. Yet your teacher took you one step at a time, not only sharing and <br>teaching but also listening and learning from you as well. <br> <br>Chances are about 99.999 percent that not all your first efforts succeeded, at least not at the lightning-fast pace you would have liked. Like the title of one well-known metaphysical book, you may have categorized your initial studies as an experiment in Rick Field's <i>Carry Water, Chop Wood </i>(J. P. Tarcher Publishing, 1985). You wanted to know when the "real" magick would begin, still ignorant of the fact that it was already in motion around you and within you. You were learning the essential lessons of patience <br>and self-discipline, enjoying and appreciating the process of the Craft rather than valuing only the end results. <br> <br>This was maddening to you at first, but if you stuck it out-and you apparently did if you're reading this-you discovered Witchcraft was a religion that required self-discipline and hard work from the individual, a coordination of body, mind, and spirit that can't be taught or learned overnight. Before any lessons would stick in your head, your wise teachers knew two things had to happen. Number one, the swelling of said head <br>had to be brought under your control, and number two, you had to learn the hard lesson that Witchcraft is a <i>process</i>, a verb rather than a noun. It might have had a markable beginning, but it has no end. Those who can't learn to carry water, chop wood, cast circles, call quarters, evoke deities, etc., with patience and a love for the process itself would never become or remain a Witch. <br> <br>In some cases, even that first year and a day was not enough to learn all the basic tenets, concepts, and practices at the journeyman's level, and definitely not long enough to master more than one or-if you were really gifted in a special area-two.You also discovered that, unlike the religion into which you were probably born, no single leader was going to step forward and do all the ritual and magickal work for you, or even explain to you after showing him your ten blistered fingers from wood chopping, <br>and your thirty-third trip to the well, what all the water and wood were for. If you still didn't get it, you might even have been asked to move the water and wood back where you found them, either literally or metaphorically. <br>Screwy religion, eh? <br> <br>At this point you might have questioned your commitment to the Craft.Whether you were aware of it or not, it was expected that you would question just what you were getting yourself into. You were the only one who knew the answers to the questions your teachers were trying to provoke you to probe:Would you have the courage to stick out <br>your entire initial training, or would you decide you knew more than your teachers and the deities and strike out on your own? Or would you realize that you wouldn't be doing all this for no purpose and stick with it even if everything didn't make sense yet? Were you sensing anything spiritual happening in your life, or were all you could see those ten blistered fingers? You might have begun to feel like a lackey, not a student, and suddenly <br>your teachers didn't seem so idyllic anymore. <br> <br>Things may be starting to seem a little less screwy now. The aforementioned frustrations were signs that you were learning, testing, thinking, feeling, and growing, whether you knew it or not. You were starting to catch on, but there was still much work to be done. <br> <br>You might also have been frustrated to madness that lessons in magick were not as forthcoming as you'd like. You were anxious to cast spells, light candles, chant, drum until dawn, call out the elementals, and evoke deities. All manner of witchy things were itching to pop like flames from your anxious fingertips (blistered or not). Yet your teachers held this knowledge back until much later in your studies <br>. <br>Even though you were starting to catch on, there was one important semantic distinction you had to understand: the difference between <i>wisdom </i>and <i>knowledge</i>. They are not, never have been, nor ever will be the same animal, even though they can appear asidentical twins. They are the beginning of our transformation from form into spirit, governed by the cerebral element of air.Within air we learn to connect all parts of our <br>minds to expand our thinking, helping us transfer our thoughts into magickal actions. <br> <br>Just like Dorothy Gale in <i>The Wizard of Oz </i>had to figure out the answer to her own problem, you also had to gain the wisdom, not just the knowledge, that your answers were within you all the time. Finding and recognizing it is the hard part, but the process you take to get there is as important as any end result. You had to attain the wisdom that your commitment to learn was ongoing, the eternal learning curve of an ancient mystery faith. <br> <br>Knowing is easy, wisdom is hard. <br> <br>So you kept carrying water and chopping wood as, one by one, bright rays of enlightenment began illuminating your mind and soul. <br> <br>Baby Steps to the Next Level <br>As an intermediate student of Witchcraft, you began to appreciate all the <br>hard work your teachers insisted on having you do; well, maybe not the ten blistered fingers, but the other stuff was okay. All your efforts-not theirs, but yours-disciplined not only your body but also your mind and spirit, and your hours of meditation and visualization practice was now paying off. Your broader view of how all these pieces fit together as a whole was making you a stronger Witch, both spiritually and in your magick <br>and ritual practices. <br> <br>As Nin-Si-Ana, a longtime priestess friend of mine, is fond of saying, "Well, whop me upside the head with the great frying pan of enlightenment." <br><i>Boing! <br> <br></i>"And, by the way, bring me another bucket of water." <br> <br>As you continued upon your chosen path, wisdom was replacing knowledge. You began to progress more rapidly. You could see the results of much of your training and so you read, and listened, and spent lots of time contemplating cosmology and eschatology to form your own theories from the thousands of others already hypothesized. You did the same with concepts of reincarnation, the web of being, the deities, and magick. <br>You blessed the foresight of your teachers for withholding lessons of specific skills until you were ready to handle them responsibly. You understood now that they weren't being dictatorial for the fun of it, but that all life is one and that they, too, would bear the karma your magick created, being as responsible for your errors in judgment as would you because they were showing you the way. <br> <br>Folk magick is owned by the common people, and it always will be, but when it becomes part of a larger religious practice you must first be well grounded in that faith's ethics and ideology before you can handle the magick with wisdom. Then it not only becomes more powerful, it centers you in the web of being from where you can draw great power. It takes experience to turn knowledge into wisdom, and there's not one of <br>us who can claim not to have singed a fingertip or two in the beginning. <br>Overall, as an intermediate, you were satisfied with your progress and, as those who have climbed the tree to knowledge before you, you yearned for more. Terms such as mage, elder, adept, sage, crone, avatar, wise woman, cunning man, master, third degree, priest, and priestess danced in your head. You knew they were synonymous with advanced practitioners of the Craft, and you desired to sort them out in your mind and find the path you needed to forge your way ahead. <br> <br>Which Brings Us to Mystery #1. . . <br>You have learned by now that advanced Witchcraft is not synonymous with <br>greater complexity, but with becoming a greater person. To do that requires both bold daring and humility. <br> <br><i>Huh? <br> <br></i>Where'd that frying pan go? At this point you may feel like giving yourself a few whacks just to enjoy the process. <br> <br>All Are Students, All Are Teachers <br>No one's definition of advancement in the Craft is going to be the same as <br>anyone else's, as we shall soon see, but our ideas of the many things that comprise advanced practice may change, expand, or contract over time. This is good. It shows we're still thinking, still questioning, and still growing as both Witches and human beings.When that process stops, life stops. <br>Take a moment to grab a pencil and write out your definition of an advanced Witch, or what you see as advanced Craft practice. If you need some time to think about it, close this book for a day or two and do just that.Meditate. Look inward.What are you and how did you get here? Where do you want to be and how will you get there? What is <br>an advanced Witch, and why are you, or do you, want to be one? <br><i>date of entry: </i>____________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br>_______________________________________________________ <br> <br>The Power Within <br>It's impossible to discuss the art of advanced Witchcraft without first trying <br>to define the advanced Witch, and it's hard to define the advanced Witch without first defining Witchcraft. For those of you standing at the doorway that opens to advanced practice, you already know the word <i>Witch </i>is derived from the Old English <i>wyk</i>, meaning "to bend or shape," and the Anglo-Saxon <i>wit</i>, meaning "to possess wisdom." <br> <br>You also know Witchcraft is a religion. If you didn't accept and practice that, then you would never have come this far. You'd either have lost interest or found that your Craft practices weren't always working right for you, and you would have left to seek another path to your life's goals. <br> <br>Being an advanced Witch is not much different than being an advanced person, a wise soul who picks battles with care and knows when the truest display of her wisdom may best be evidenced by her silence. Some battles cannot be won, and there's no point trying. This is why you don't often see real Witches on daytime talk shows arguing moot points with people who are gathering kindling and tying nooses. The producers of these shows don't want to know the truth about what we are and what we do any more than <br>the audience. They want a good old-fashioned knock-down, drag-out war between what they hope their slack-jawed, glaze-eyed viewers will see as a holy war between good and evil. <br> <br>One of the hallmarks of the advanced Witch is when he reaches a point where he loses the urge to argue minute points <i>ad infinitum </i>with both outsiders and with other Witches. Take a look in the letters to the editor in most Pagan periodicals or in online chat rooms. The childish bickering and name-calling will turn your stomach. Some of the writers may sign themselves as "The Great Poobah Grand Guru and Fifth Degree High Priest of the Coven of the One Universal Truth," but the real truth is that they <br>haven't passed all the tests required of the first-year novice. They may display some knowledge but they are clearly lacking in wisdom. They certainly have never developed the inner qualities it takes to be an advanced human being. Perhaps they don't want to. Perhaps the personal power trip is enough for them, or perhaps they just don't know any better. In any case, if one of these gurus reaches out for you, run fast and far. <br> <br>A Witch's greatest strength can often be found in her silence. Remember that one of our "rules" for successful magick is the admonition to keep silent and not lessen the power by talking about it or risking someone else working to counter our desire. A Witch exudes a quiet power that commands respect because it does not stand out and scream, "Look at me, I am right."He feels no need to argue every point someone brings up, such as what attributes the color blue possesses. <br> <br>An advanced Witch also refrains from making value judgments about the spiritual path others choose to take.We are all in our religions to reunite with our creator regardless of how we see him/her/them/it.We have no trouble stepping out of the limelight and retreating to a quiet corner all alone to commune with our deities while the rest of the world battles over the valid uses of a cinnamon stick or who is more powerful, Yahweh or Allah-two deities who are the same. We know both religions have validity, meaning they succeed in keeping in mind their higher purpose. Even worse, we all know no one wins these marathon arguments. All it does is distract us from the greater work we have chosen to do and places us further from, not nearer to, our creator(s). <br> <br>It has often been said of Witchcraft that "The secret is that there is no secret," or that "The one universal truth is that there is no one universal truth." This mutability of "truth" is impossible for many people to grasp because it topples the foundation upon which their faith is built. If you crack that foundation, the whole building comes crumbling down, like those fabled walls of Jericho. The thought of being cut loose from a group mindset has frightened all of us at one time or another.

The second volume of the work delves even deeper than did the first into the subtle tactics of resistance and private practices that make living a subversive art. Michel de Certeau, Luce Giard, and Pierre Mayol develop a social history of &#x201c;making do&#x201d; based on microhistories that move from the private sphere (of dwelling, cooking, and homemaking) to the public (the experience of living in a neighborhood). A series of interviews&#x2014;mostly with women&#x2014;allows us to follow the subjects&#x2019; individual routines, composed of the habits, constraints, and inventive strategies by which the speakers negotiate daily life. Through these accounts the speakers, &#x201c;ordinary&#x201d; people all, are revealed to be anything but passive consumers. Amid these experiences and voices, the ephemeral inventions of the &#x201c;obscure heroes&#x201d; of the everyday, we watch the art of making do become the art of living.This long-awaited second volume of de Certeau&#x2019;s masterwork, updated and revised in this first English edition, completes the picture begun in volume 1, drawing to the last detail the collective practices that define the texture, substance, and importance of the everyday.Michel de Certeau (1925-1986) wrote numerous books that have been translated into English, including Heterologies (1986), The Capture of Speech (1998), and Culture in the Plural (1998), all published by Minnesota.

Why did God give the kingdom to David and his sons forever by a covenant of salt? Why is salt sometimes substituted for blood in making covenant?

That time, my friend, has long passed. I&#x2019;m in my forties now, and me and my muffin top&#x2014;that chubby little bulge of tummy that refuses to stay tucked away behind the top button of my jeans but insists on grinning around at the world over the top of my waistband&#x2014;are on the closest of terms. Maybe more so than I would like.</p><p>It is one of the landmarks of my middle. Literally. And metaphorically. Because when I bump up against that chunky midsection that I&#x2019;m trying to accept, it&#x2019;s with the same surprise I feel late at night after I&#x2019;ve exhausted another day of being in charge of my own life and the lives of all these people who live in our house, plus the cats.</p><p>I keep waiting to feel like a grown-up while going through all the grown-up motions. I&#x2019;m not sure if these are the things you&#x2019;re supposed to say out loud. But isn&#x2019;t it weird to have all the responsibilities of a grown-up and look like a grown-up and have a grown-up job and a grown-up mortgage and still not be sure how or when to change the air filters?</p><p>It&#x2019;s a shock to find myself here in the middle. I&#x2019;m pretty much at the halfway point of my life. What on earth? In true muffin-top character, it is not glamorous. This middle is mostly the part where it&#x2019;s easy to pass by without slowing down long enough to pay attention. You just want to tuck that chubby midsection into your pants, drape a flowy shirt over it, and call it &#x201c;good enough.&#x201d; You know what I&#x2019;m talking about, yes? What this middle, muffin-top stage of life looks like?</p><p>Maybe like me you&#x2019;ve now lived longer with your man than without, and that&#x2019;s insane. Because when you were eighteen, maybe you also swore you&#x2019;d never be anyone&#x2019;s wife or mother, and now he knows every nook, cranny, and (let&#x2019;s face it) pockmark of your &#x201c;wonderland.&#x201d; And you are a reluctant connoisseur when it comes to the entire range of his nightly snore repertoire. You both wear glasses and secretly enjoy going to Costco. Your kids are toddling into middle school or high school instead of just around your living room. And while on the outside you look like a grown-up, your inside self is still frozen in time at your favorite age, but you no longer recognize the tween celebrities featured on magazines at the checkout aisle.</p><p>Instead, you leaf through the home decor mags while waiting to pay for the mound of food it now takes to feed your constantly starving tiny humans who are no longer tiny and sometimes walk into the living room, wink, and call you &#x201c;Woman!&#x201d; Your kids are human Shazams for all the songs you no longer recognize on the radio, and when you watch movies these days, you&#x2019;re rooting for the parents instead of the angsty teens.</p><p>There are so many soccer and football and dance practices that you often drive to the wrong location or show up at the wrong time on the wrong day. And maybe there&#x2019;s still one little left in the house who gets schlepped along to all the bigs&#x2019; sporting events, and you end up feeling bad for her and sometimes for yourself that you both have to be on the bleachers so much. None of these are bad things&#x2014;they&#x2019;re just the pebble stuck in the bottom of your shoe that at first is only annoying but on the hard days makes you want to throw that shoe across the room.<br><br></p><p><b>Welcome to the muffin-top middle!</b></p><p>Normal feels all stretched out and squidgy around the edges when you&#x2019;re splitting time and to-dos, yet it&#x2019;s the stuff of life and marriage and kids and work that everyone lives. And now there&#x2019;s also the reality of retirement as more than just that infomercial you used to fast-forward through but also something you will actually need in the no-longer-distant future. And there&#x2019;s the no-less-essential investment of fighting for time to keep dating the man you&#x2019;re raising kids with so you feel like a couple and not just a couple of people running a summer camp together.</p><p>Add to that the more mundane (but still significant) figuring out of new school systems that require you to give five days&#x2019; advance notice to make a change to the bus schedule and how that complicates organizing playdates for while you&#x2019;re out of town. (Although your kids tell you that you&#x2019;re embarrassing them and &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a playdate, Mom; it&#x2019;s called hanging out.&#x201d;) But you&#x2019;re the grown-up, and while this still surprises you, this is the work of grown-ups: organizing the boring details that keep a family chugging along.</p><p>This is the stuff of our seasons right now. How we wake up to morning breath and steal quickie Sunday afternoon love and hope we can also squeeze in a just-as-sexy nap. These are the years of driving the curving bends of our neighborhood between school and practices and parent-teacher conferences and games and study sessions and recitals and the gas station and the grocery store, every morning and afternoon and evening and never getting tired of the golden, glorious trees while we often get tired of the driving.</p><p>This is just what we do. We drive and feed and keep breaking our days and our lives wide open. We have winding conversations about sports and pop culture and try to explain Kim Kardashian to our tweens while our middles get squishier. It takes work to keep paying attention, to keep parenting with intention, because there&#x2019;s a lazy side of us that just wants to hit cruise control and sleep in now that our kids are sleeping through the night. Please tell me you know what I&#x2019;m talking about here?</p><p>But the stakes are higher now because our kids can remember our mistakes. Combine that with the side of insanity that comes with finally understanding what work you feel meant and fulfilled to do, while also constantly having to juggle it with the schedules of everyone else who lives in your house, including the pets. I&#x2019;ve been giving eye drops six times a day to one of my kids and also one of my cats. What on earth? At night the fish need to be fed, and I never remember to actually go pick the tomatoes we tried to grow in our garden this year.</p><p>Over and over and over again.</p><p>The middle is the place where our lives really live. This is the place where we have grown into the shapes of our souls even as we might have outgrown the shapes of our jeans.</p><p>The middle is the marrow. The glorious ordinary of your life that utterly exhausts you but that you might have finally started to understand in ways you didn&#x2019;t at the beginning. Listen, I&#x2019;m not asking you to seize the day here; I&#x2019;m just asking you to actually see it. Even if just out of the corner of one eye. The middle is worth remembering while you are actually living it, because you won&#x2019;t pass by this way again.</p><p>So it&#x2019;s worth slowing down long enough on random afternoons to really look around at your life and your husband and the human beings you are raising together and let it sink in that you&#x2019;ve grown up and that it&#x2019;s good. You are living at the very center of what will be your story. Right now. Let&#x2019;s stop long enough to read a few lines of these lives out loud. Because trust me when I tell you, sister, the middle is worth reading.</p><p>The middle is ridiculous and terrible, so funny and so much fun, and also so exhausting. But it&#x2019;s the stuff of the stories our kids will one day tell about us. These are the days of miracle and wonder. The stories we will one day tell each other as we laugh at all those times we spent all those hours carpooling kids all over the planet of our neighborhood. These are the stories that will line our empty nests one day. We are living the memories that will be passed down to the ones who are still living their beginnings. The middle is the gift you didn&#x2019;t know you were right in the middle of, friend.</p><p>Seriously.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s relish the middle. Let&#x2019;s savor the middle. Let&#x2019;s embrace the middle in all its mundane glory. Because maybe the middle isn&#x2019;t so bad. Maybe we don&#x2019;t want to hide it, ignore it, or miss it. Sister, maybe the middle is the part where it really starts to get good!</p></p><h2>Girl Genius: The Second Journey of Agatha Heterodyne Volume 5: Queens &amp; Pirates</h2><p>Adventure, Romance, Mad Science!

Doty's poetic career really took off with <i>My Alexandria </i>(1993), his third book, which made his reputation. <i>Fire to Fire</i> contains only two poems from his first two books&#x2014;Adonis Theatre, about an old movie palace turned gay porno theater, and The Death of Antinous, about the Roman emperor Hadrian's lover's afterlife in statuary, both of which are meditations on representation, absence and desire. Desire, and its capacity to transform and transfigure, is one of Doty's main themes. Enough desire (so often mixed, as T.S. Eliot wrote, with memory) can make us as beautiful as the objects of our desire. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Doty has never eschewed beauty. Indeed, beauty, its unlikely, often unexpected, yet constant recurrence and its elusive fleetingness, is central, as demonstrated by several new poems titled Theory of Beauty, each with a parenthetical specific occasion. Beauty is found everywhere in Doty's poems, in a band playing cast-off chemical drums in Times Square, even in Chet Baker falling from an Amsterdam hotel window: a blur of buds//breathing in the lindens/and you let go and why not.The title poem Fire to Fire, from <i>School of the Arts</i> (2005) is a gorgeous meditation on the way that life's fire infuses the world, in sunflowers, goldfinches, and even a neighbor's puppy: fire longs to meet itself/flaring, longing wants a multiplicity of faces,//branching and branching out. The selections from The Vault (which really needs to be read in its entirety) reveal the poetry in men meeting other men's bodies in a sex club, incorporating references to the Middle English poem Western Wind and to James Wright's A Blessing, and including a subtle revision of Rilke's Orpheus. Eurydice. Hermes in which the men are deep in the club's mine of souls, that shaft where inner and outer//grow indissoluble. At times the poems unnecessarily explain what their vivid images and striking phrases makes clear, but the commitment to the particular, and to its possibilities, is unwavering. As Doty writes in Ararat, Any small thing can save you. The poems combine close attention to the fragile, contingent things of the world with the constant, almost unavoidable chance of transcendence, since desire can make anything into a god.<i>Reginald Shepherd's most recent books are</i> Fata Morgana, <i>poems</i>, <i>and the just-published</i> Orpheus in the Bronx, <i>prose on poetry</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For the first time in human history, the globe is dominated by one economic system. In <i>Capitalism, Alone,</i> leading economist Branko Milanovic explains the reasons for this decisive historical shift since the days of feudalism and, later, communism. Surveying the varieties of capitalism, he asks: What are the prospects for a fairer world now that capitalism is the only game in town? His conclusions are sobering, but not fatalistic. Capitalism gets much wrong, but also much right&#x2015;and it is not going anywhere. Our task is to improve it.</p><p>Milanovic argues that capitalism has triumphed because it works. It delivers prosperity and gratifies human desires for autonomy. But it comes with a moral price, pushing us to treat material success as the ultimate goal. And it offers no guarantee of stability. In the West, liberal capitalism creaks under the strains of inequality and capitalist excess. That model now fights for hearts and minds with political capitalism, exemplified by China, which many claim is more efficient, but which is more vulnerable to corruption and, when growth is slow, social unrest. As for the economic problems of the Global South, Milanovic offers a creative, if controversial, plan for large-scale migration. Looking to the future, he dismisses prophets who proclaim some single outcome to be inevitable, whether worldwide prosperity or robot-driven mass unemployment. Capitalism is a risky system. But it is a human system. Our choices, and how clearly we see them, will determine how it serves us.</p></p><p>Branko Milanovic is Visiting Presidential Professor and Core Faculty at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. He was formerly Lead Economist in the World Bank&#x2019;s research department. His books include <i>Global Inequality</i> (Harvard) and <i>The Haves and the Have-Nots: A Brief and Idiosyncratic History of Global Inequality</i>.&#x201c;A brilliant sequel to the pathbreaking <i>Global Inequality</i>. Drawing on original research and a typically wide sweep of history, Branko Milanovic poses all the important questions about our future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gordon Brown, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</b><br><br>&#x201c;Branko Milanovic, a master economic statistician, here divides modern capitalism broadly into two versions: the &#x2018;liberal&#x2019; one found in the West, and the &#x2018;political&#x2019; one that has emerged in China. In this searching and richly argued work he weighs the choices we face and discusses whether the future may lie with one version, alone.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James K.

He contrasts this with the &#x2018;political capitalism&#x2019; found in many emerging countries, with China as the exemplar. These two capitalistic forms now dominate the global landscape.

Acupuncturist and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Jason Elias joins with Katherine Ketcham to help women access the feminine (yin) energy that has been overlooked by conventional medical science. Examining the major phases of a woman&#39;s life from puberty through menopause and into &#34;the wisdom gathering years&#34;, Ellas and Ketcham offer gentle, natural remedies that can be used to complement conventional treatments to promote health, emotional well-being, and spiritual enrichment. In this life-affirming book, you will discover the traditional Chinese interpretations of PMS, fibroids, and menstrual irregularities; time-honored acupuncture and herbal treatments for menopausal symptoms, pregnancy problems, and postpartum care; life-enhancing exercises for older women; and many other therapies. Combining practical information with a wealth of myths, parables, and metaphors from many wisdom traditions, In the House of the Moon will help you reconnect with your own potential for healing and wholeness.While practicing psychotherapy in New York City, Elias became interested in the effectiveness of the mind and the body working in tandem to heal. Having already studied Gestalt therapy at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif., he took off on a tour of the world to study Eastern medical traditions. His practice as reconfigured by these experiences focuses on traditional Chinese medicine, and particularly on the "Five Transforming Powers" of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. Each is described at length, with associated physical and mental types and the problems attendant to an excess or deficiency of the various humors. Elias illustrates how acupuncture, herbs, diet and, importantly, understanding underlying emotional issues can correct imbalances, release vital energy and remedy problems with menopause, osteoporosis, and PMS. This is not really for a DIY-er unless you're comfortable with self-administered acupuncture. The aim is more inspirational. Annoyingly, though, inspirational zeal sometimes obscures fact, as when a story about the Sumerian goddess Inanna's trip to the netherworld aimed at "reclaiming the feminine spirit of healing" neatly sidesteps a crucial player?Inanna's older sister Ereshkigal, Destroyer of Life. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Joseph Haydn, The Merry Little Peasant</h2><p>This is a simple, inspiring children&#39;s biography of the great musician Haydn. This story, like all the stories of the great composers by Wheeler and Deucher, will win its way into the hearts of all music-loving children; for it, too, is told with all the understanding, sympathy and appreciation that its two inspired authors have to give. &#34;Little Sepperl [as the child Franz Joseph Haydn was called] always sat on a wooden stool near his father and with two smooth pieces of wood held firmly in his hands, played his own make-believe violin. His parents watched the boy drawing one stick slowly across the other as he played so seriously, keeping perfect time.&#34; Then one day he went to live with his cousin in a town near Vienna, close by the river Danube. There he learned to read music and sing. Once when the drummer was too sick to march in a procession, little Franz Joseph was asked to take his place. So he practiced all day on the meal barrel with a cloth tied over the top...until he could play the part without a single mistake. Such was the musical beginning of the boy who later played before kings in palaces, and who has left us some of the most beautiful music ever written. For boys and girls, from 8 to 12 years of age, this book is particularly recommended. It has the great value of being instructive, cultural and inspiring, as well as recreational.</p><p></p><h2>A Witch Come True (The Apprentice Witch)</h2><p>The war is over and Arianwyn has discovered the secret of the quiet glyphs, but her troubles are far from over.

And then<br> I realized that it was the night&#x2014;the night was nibbling<br> into me.<br> It wasn&#x2019;t that late, still only twilight, but the darkness<br> seemed to have collected just above my shoulders. A black<br> clump of it had fastened onto me, eating away at my back.<br> I wriggled, trying to shake it off, but the night clung<br> fast. When I tried to rip it off with my hands, it floated<br> away, as vapour, and I couldn&#x2019;t grasp it. I grabbed at a<br> patch, where it was most intensely black, but immediately<br> it dispersed, and another black patch swirled up somewhere<br> else.<br> The itchiness became unbearable. I scratched frantically.<br> The more I scratched, the more the darkness ate into<br> my back, and the more the darkness ate into my back, the<br> more I itched.<br> Unable to stand still, I broke into a run.<br> Immediately, I was running as fast as a horse. I thought,<br> as I ran: you get faster when the night starts eating into<br> you. Roads, pedestrians, signs, all fly by, retreating into the<br> distance, like scenes through a train window.<br> After a minute or two I grew sick of running, so I stopped.<br> My body was giving off steam like a horse. I was breathing<br> loudly through my nose. Some of the darkness merged with<br> the steam, producing swirling, hazy eddies.<br> People, standing at a distance, stared.<br> The darkness mixed with the breaths I was taking in,<br> reappearing when I breathed out, floating in long trails.<br> When I inhaled, the dark trails near my nostrils were sucked<br> back in. When I exhaled again, they were longer than before.<br> The darkness grew, stretching out like endless ribbons,<br> issuing forth from my nostrils.<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a sight you don&#x2019;t see every day,&#x201d; an onlooker<br> exclaimed, and then clapped, purposefully, as if summoning<br> koi to the surface of a pond. The other onlookers clapped<br> too, in just the same way.<br> I grew irritated. &#x201c;Get the fuck outta here!&#x201d; I tried to shout.<br> But no words emerged from my mouth. I couldn&#x2019;t get the<br> first consonant out. Straining, blowing through my nostrils,<br> bearing down, I tried for that first sound: &#x201c;G&#x2014; G&#x2014; G&#x2014;&#x201d; But<br> all I could manage was to snort and blow out air.<br> The onlookers were delighted, and clapped some more.<br> This infuriated me. I leapt into the air, trying to yell at<br> them, but all that came out was a whinny&#x2014;like I was a horse.<br> I kept leaping. Landing on a roof, I whinnied again&#x2014;and<br> then again. The onlookers below were all clapping. I wasn&#x2019;t<br> going to be outdone by them, and I kept whinnying. By now<br> I had acquired a horse&#x2019;s body, and was covered with a thick<br> black coat of hair.<br> &#x201c;Night&#x2019;s coming. The Night Horse has arrived,&#x201d; an<br> onlooker said&#x2014;the first in the crowd to have clapped. At<br> that moment the steam started to rise in clouds off my body.<br> More darkness: spreading, covering everything.<br> Elated now, I whinnied over and over again. With every<br> whinny, the darkness became blacker and more intense.<br>2 Chaos<br> While I was walking, the number of people increased. We<br> were all going in the same direction. I walked, swept along<br> in the flow.<br> It was after dusk, an hour closer to night. I could see the<br> outlines of people walking just ahead of me, but couldn&#x2019;t<br> tell the colour of their clothes. A lamplighter approached,<br> holding a long pole, pushing his way against the stream of<br> people. Raising the pole up to a lamp, he let it rest there a<br> few seconds, and the lamp started to glow. Looking around,<br> I realized that there were several lamplighters: everywhere<br> about me, one street lamp after another started to give out<br> a steady light.<br> Now there were even more people walking, and it was<br> difficult keeping up the pace.<br> &#x201c;Are you going too?&#x201d;<br> I glanced over my shoulder, and saw a slender girl with<br> short hair walking behind me.<br> &#x201c;I was thinking about it...,&#x201d; I answered, without quite<br> committing myself.<br> Hearing this, the girl, who didn&#x2019;t stop walking, removed<br> an envelope from her satchel, and opened it, all the while<br> keeping pace with the stream of people.<br> In the envelope were some green tickets.<br> &#x201c;I have an extra. You take it,&#x201d; she said, as she quickly<br> slipped the green ticket into my pocket. I was going to<br> thank her&#x2014;but she waved me off and pointed at the<br> people behind us. Some kind of hitch had stopped the<br> flow of people, and there was a pile-up. Knots of people<br> were starting to form, and as more people kept coming<br> from behind them, soon some of the knots were getting<br> pushed up into the air, on top of the knots of people below<br> them.<br> Quickly I turned to face forward again, and started<br> to walk. A long gap had opened up between us and the<br> people in front of us. Thinking I ought to catch up with<br> them, I broke into a run. But again the girl stopped me.<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t run, or we&#x2019;ll have chaos. It&#x2019;s too early. Too early.&#x201d;<br> I didn&#x2019;t understand what she was referring to, but in<br> any case I resumed walking.<br> We seemed to be approaching a termination point. The<br> stream of people was spreading out. Just ahead, something<br> very tall was rising up to the sky.<br> Several dozen ticket collectors stood in a row, and once<br> we passed through, showing our tickets, the tall object<br> came into better view.<br> It was a singer, who stood as tall as a three-storey building.<br> From where I was, I had a clear view of the beauty spot<br> under her jaw, and the rise and fall of her breasts.<br> &#x201c;The beauty spot is artificial,&#x201d; the girl informed me,<br> gazing up at the singer, enraptured.<br> The singer was producing notes at different pitches, as<br> if she were warming up. When she sang high notes, flocks<br> of birds took flight from the branches of the gingko trees.<br> When she sang low notes, the earth heaved, and small<br> furry creatures emerged from underground and crawled<br> about.<br> When the square was packed with people, suddenly,<br> with no warning, the singer commenced singing. It was<br> as if an immense musical instrument was filling the<br> firmament with sound, or as if the melody of her song<br> was swimming through the skies... In the next moment<br> her voice had overwhelmed all else, and rather than<br> listening, we seemed to be encompassed within it. No<br> longer able to know the words, we were conscious only<br> that her lilting voice was, slowly and powerfully, all<br> around us.<br> The crowd of people, filled with her music, started to<br> break up and form lines, which began to flow from the<br> square in every direction, like innumerable streams flowing<br> from a lake.<br> &#x201c;The chaos has started,&#x201d; the girl said to me, joining a<br> stream of people going by her. I watched as she was borne<br> away.<br> I joined the same stream of people, and pretty soon<br> caught up with her.<br> &#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d; I enquired. The girl nodded several<br> times, her eyes closed, looking unworried.<br> &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; I asked again.<br> &#x201c;The night,&#x201d; she replied.<br> With that, her head tilted downwards, and she fell into<br> a deep sleep. She was carried along as she slept.<br> Now a part of the chaos, alongside the girl, I entered<br> the night.</p><h2>Black River</h2><p><b>An Indie Next Title � An Indies Introduce Title � Long-listed for the 2015 Center for Fiction First Novel Prize<br><br> &#x201c;Impressive . . .

This thief would hang around the diamond district to see who was purchasing a gem, so that later he could pick their pocket. </p><p>One day he saw a well-known diamond merchant purchase the jewel he had been waiting for all his life. It was the most beautiful, the most pristine, the purest of diamonds. He was very excited, and so he followed the diamond merchant as he boarded the train, getting into the same compartment. He spent a three-day journey trying to pick the merchant's pocket and obtain the diamoond. When the end of the journey came and he hadn't found the gem, he was very frustrated. He was an accomplished thief, and although he had emplyed all his skills, he still was not able to steal this rare and precious jewel. </p><p>When the diamond merchant got off the train, the pickpocket followed him once again. Finally, he just couldn't stand it any more, and he walked up to the merchant and said, "Sir, I am a renowned diamond thief. I saw you purchase that beautiful diamond, so I followed you onto the train. Though I used all the skills of my art, which have been perfected over many years, I was not able to find the gem. I must know your secret. Tell me, please, how did you hide it from me? </p><p>The diamond merchant replied, "Well, I saw you watching me in the diamond district, and I suspected you were a pickpocket. So I hid the diamond where I thought you would be least likely to look for it - in your own pocket!" He then reached into the thief's pocket and pulled out the diamond. </p><p>The treasure that I invite you to receive, that I will continually be pointing to throughout this book, is in your pocket right now, the pocket of your heart. The heart that I speak of is even closer to you than your emotional heart. It is the heart that is the core of your being. Ant step to go somewhere to find it it implies that it is not already right here where you are. Simply see the radiant bounty of your true nature, accept that bounty, and then you will share that bounty quite naturally.</p></p><h2>Still Life: An FBI Mystery Suspense Thriller Workplace Second Chance Romance (Chesapeake Valor)</h2><p><b>Romantic Suspense's Rising Star Continues to Win Fans<br></b><br>Blacklisted in the photography business over a controversial shot, Avery Tate answered an ad for a crime scene photographer.

Taking sharp aim at the romanticized, whitewashed mythology perpetrated by this southern classic, Randall has ingeniously conceived a multilayered, emotionally complex tale of her own - that of Cynara, the mulatto half-sister, who, beautiful and brown and born into slavery, manages to break away from the damaging world of the Old South to emerge into full life as a daughter, a lover, a mother, a victor. THE WIND DONE GONE is a passionate love story, a wrenching portrait of a tangled mother-daughter relationship, and a book that &#34;celebrates a people&#39;s emancipation not only from bondage but also from history and myth, custom and stereotype&#34; (San Antonio Express-News).</p><p>Alice Randall was born in Detroit and graduated from Harvard in 1981. After a start as a journalist in Washington, D.C., she moved to Nashville to become a country songwriter. The only African-American woman ever to write a number-one country song, she has had more than twenty songs recorded. She is also a screenwriter and has worked on adaptations of Their Eyes Were Watching God, Parting the Waters, and Brer Rabbit. Alice Randall is the author of The Wind Done Gone. She was awarded the Free Spirit Award in 2001 and the Literature Award of Excellence by the Memphis Black Writers Conference in 2002, and she was a finalist for the NAACP Image Award in 2002. She lives in Nashville, Tennessee.1<br><br>Today is the anniversary of my birth. I have twenty-eight years. This diary and the pen I am writing with are the best gifts I got -- except maybe my cake. R. gave me the diary, the pen, and the white frosted tiers. He also gave me emerald earbobs. I think maybe my emeralds are just green glass; I hope maybe they be genuine peridots.<br> I was born May 25, 1845, at half-past seven in the morning into slavery on a cotton farm a day&#x2019;s ride from Atlanta. My father, Planter, was the master of the place; my mother was the Mammy. My half-sister, Other, was the belle of five counties. She was not beautiful, but men seldom recognized this, caught up in the cloud of commotion and scent in which she moved. R. certainly didn&#x2019;t; he married her. But then again, he just left her. Maybe that means something to me. Maybe he&#x2019;s just the unseldom one who do recognize.<br><br> 2<br><br>If I strip the flesh off my bones, like they stripped the clothes off my flesh in the slave market down near the battery in Charleston, this would be my skeleton: childhood on a cotton farm; a time of shawl-fetch slavery away in Charleston; a bare-breasted hour on an auction block; drudge slavery as a maid in Beauty&#x2019;s Atlanta brothel, when Milledgeville was the capital of Georgia and Atlanta was nothing; a season of candle-flame concubinage in the attic of that house; a watery Grand Tour of Europe; and, finally, concubinage in my own white clapboard home, with green shutters and gaslights, in the center (near the train depot) of a fast-growing city that has become the capital of Georgia, concubinage that persists till now. How many miles have I traveled to come back to here?<br><br> 3<br><br>They called me Cinnamon because I was skinny as a stick and brown. But my name is Cynara. Now when I tell it, I say they called me Cinnamon because I was sweet and spicy. Sweet, hot, strong, and black -- like a good cup of coffee. Leastways, that&#x2019;s how Planter liked his coffee.<br> Planter used to say I was his cinnamon and Mammy was his coffee.<br> He said those words a day I had gotten into trouble dashing before Other upon the stained-glass colored light that fell in rows of blue and pink diamonds down the wide hall of the big house. If I was ten years old, it must have been 1855. I bumped into the leg of the Hewitt sideboard. Other was ten years old too. It was one of those days we had back when everything seemed it would always be just as it has always been. Everything and everyone had a place and rested deep in it, or so it seemed that day to would-be knights and ten-year- olds. Then I bumped into that carved leg, and the shell-shaped bonbon dish jumped off Lady&#x2019;s sideboard as if it just wanted to split into a hundred porcelain shards on the lemon-oiled pine floor. Something had changed, and I had changed it. Someone wanted to beat me. Mammy said she&#x2019;d beat me good, with a belt. Other lied and said she&#x2019;d knocked into the table. Said it &#x2019;cause she knew it would pain Mammy to give me a whipping.<br> And sometimes Planter said it when he heard me making up little rhymes to sing to myself. Sometimes when Mammy was putting Other to sleep on a day pallet for a nap, he would call for me to sit at his feet on the broad porch and sing my little songs to him. Cindy, come sing, come sing! Ain&#x2019;t you my Cinnamon and she my coffee?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d ask. And I&#x2019;d be slow to go, because I knew someone might be missing me.<br> On the day Planter told me I was leaving the place, I asked him what he had meant when he said that I was his cinnamon and she was his coffee. He said to me, I mean a man can do without his cinnamon but he can&#x2019;t do without his coffee.&#x201d; I poked my lip out. I mean you&#x2019;re a gracious plenty.&#x201d; I belong here?&#x201d; Gracious plenty foreign to me child.&#x201d; R. says Planter was an Irishman and all Irish are shiftless, lazy crackers, no matter how rich they get. He always wants me to look outside the neighborhood for models of my deportment. He often mentions that Georgia was once a penal colony. The first time he said it, I didn&#x2019;t know what a penal colony&#x201d; was. He says only the English and the French know anything about gracious plenty. He says when Planter and Mammy got together, they cooked a broth too rich for potato-water blood.<br> It was Planter who sent me away, but he got the go-ahead from Mama. It was the year his third son died, and he said it would be a good turn for me. I was thirteen the day they rode me off. It was 1858.<br> Mammy was my Mama. Even though she let me go, I miss her. I miss her every time I look into a mirror and see her eyes. Sometimes I comb through my long springy curls and pretend that the hand holding the comb is hers. But I don&#x2019;t know what that looks like. TThen I wish I was Other, the girl whose sausage curls I&#x2019;ve seen Mammy comb and comb.

He won the Thurber Prize for his novel<i> The Other Shulman</i> and collaborated with Billy Crystal on the Tony Award&#x2013;winning play <i>700 Sundays</i>. Zweibel and his wife, Robin, live in Short Hills, New Jersey, because they enjoy paying exorbitantly high property taxes.How do two humorists effectively collaborate on a novel? By each writing the narrative for his character, alternating the perspectives in an insane adventure. Phillip Horkman is a by-the-rules kind of guy, a pet-store owner and soccer referee. Jeffrey Peckerman is a profane forensic plumber who thinks the world is populated with jerks, with the exception of himself. The New Jersey suburban dads collide when Horkman disqualifies what would have been a game-winning score made by Peckerman&#x2019;s daughter. The two embark on escalating violence that takes them on a wild car chase that gets viewed as a possible terrorist threat by the police. On the run, they travel by cruise ship, submarine, helicopter, freighter, and airplane to Cuba, Somalia, China, and the Middle East, wreaking havoc and inadvertently checking off a lot of items on the U.S. geopolitical to-do list along the way. Barry, humor columnist for the Miami Herald, and Zweibel, award-winning comedy writer originally with Saturday Night Live, are more than effective in this collaboration, although the gag of two lunatics on the run sometimes wears a bit thin.

He structures his work around four battles: Trafalgar, Jutland, Midway, and the Atlantic. Each was defined by a particular weapons system. Yet for all the importance of technology, ways of living were as important as methods of fighting. Keegan's aphoristically stimulating theses include the suggestion that "man killing" rather than "ship killing" decided Trafalgar. The behavior of Kaiser Wilhelm's navy in World War I is described as conditioned by an officer corps readier to die heroically than to keep the sea for months and years on end. Such insights show Keegan at his best: blazing trails for others to footnote. Recommended for most collections.<br><i>- Dennis E.

But for all these gains, today we face a new set of challenges, ones complicated by political and professional shifts that threaten to fundamentally change the health of populations. <br><br><em>Healthier</em> is both an affirmation and an essential summary of the current challenges and opportunities for those working in and around the improvement of population health. The essays contained here champion an approach to health that is consequentialist and rooted in social justice -- an expansion of traditional, quantitatively motivated public health that will both inform and inspire any reader from student to seasoned practitioner. <br><br>Galea's cogent, incisive arguments guarantee that his perspective, currently at the forefront of public health, will soon become conventional wisdom.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sandro Galea, MD, DrPH,</strong> is the Robert A. Knox Professor and Dean at the School of Public Health at Boston University. A physician and epidemiologist interested in the social production of health of urban populations, his work explores innovative cells-to-society approaches to population health questions with an overall aim of advancing a consequentialist approach to population health scholarship.

Focusing closely on the perpetrators and exploring the process of decision making, Longerich convincingly shows that anti-Semitism was not a mere by-product of the Nazis' political mobilization or an attempt to deflect the attention of the masses. Rather, from 1933, anti-Jewish policy was a central tenet of the Nazi movement's attempts to implement, disseminate, and secure National Socialist rule-and one which crucially shaped Nazi policy decisions. <br><br> <em>Holocaust</em> is perhaps most remarkable for its extensive use of the 1930s archives of the Central Association of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith, which re-emerged in the 1990s after years languishing in Moscow. The letters and reports from this archive document in detail the attacks suffered by ordinary Jewish people from their German neighbors. They show how, contrary to what has been believed in the past, the German populace responded relatively enthusiastically to Nazi anti-Semitism. <br> <br> This long-awaited English edition has been fully updated by Longerich himself. It features revised appendices with notes and further reading, as well as a new preface by the author. In addition, Longerich has added new material on the Jewish victims and on the camps and the ghettos, and has extended the story from the end of the war right up to the present day. In all, it is the most complete treatment ever published on the history of this monumental tragedy. <br><br>Named a 2010 Book of the Year by <em>Atlantic Monthly</em></p><p><br><strong>Peter Longerich</strong> is Professor of Modern German History and Director of the Research Centre for the Holocaust and Twentieth-Century History at Royal Holloway, University of London. His books include <em>Heinrich Himmler: A Life, The Unwritten Order: Hitler's Role in the Final Solution</em>, and <em>The Systematic</em> <em>Character of the National Socialist Policy for the Extermination of the Jews</em>.<br>*Starred Review* Skeptics who maintain there is little of value left to learn about the Holocaust should read this superb and provocative work originally published in German in 1998. Now revised and published in English for the first time, it offers relatively new data as well as a convincing thesis regarding the genesis and execution of systematic genocide. Longerich rejects the assertions of so-called &#x201c;structuralists&#x201d; who view the &#x201c;Final Solution&#x201d; as a byproduct of the war, which implies that anti-Jewish policies simply &#x201c;got out of control&#x201d; under wartime stress. Rather, extermination of Jews was the logical result of the virulent race hatred of the Nazis. Furthermore, Longerich shows that this hatred of Jews was prevalent in Germany well before the Nazi ascension to power in 1933. As expected, it permeated parties of the Right, but it infected all aspects of German society. This is a scholarly work relying heavily on letters, reports, and statistics, but it does not neglect the shattering anguish of individual humans. This is a vital addition to the field of Holocaust studies. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Understanding Homeland Security</h2><p><p>Gus Martin&#x2019;s <strong>Understanding Homeland Security</strong> provides students with a comprehensive introduction to U.S. homeland security in the modern world, with a focus on the post-September 11, 2001 era.

George Santayana (1863&#x2013;1952)</em></p><br><p>This book grew out of an International Women&#x2019;s Day event created and organized by female theological students in Toronto, Canada. Those of us invited to be panelists were asked to talk about a woman we admired in the history of the Christian Church. During our discussions, it became all too readily apparent that theological students were quite unaware of the rich history and extensive contributions of female leadership in the church over the centuries. Even church history specialists had little or no knowledge of female leaders apart from a few early martyrs.</p><br><p>The general public is of course even less aware. When I mentioned this project to one friend, she said, &#x201c;Well, that will be a thin book.&#x201d; Another woman told me that she had heard of a monastic community in the middle ages that was supervised by women, but likely I would find it because it was unique.</p><br><p>This, then, is an attempt to make the thousands or millions of women leaders in the Christian Church over the centuries better known.</p><br><p>I have to confess, though, that even I was not fully aware of all the remarkable research that has been accomplished recently in this area and the many women who have been uncovered and brought back from obscurity. I was reminded of one of my New Testament professors when I was at graduate school, who wrote his dissertation on one aspect of the life and work of Saint Paul. Wanting to be thorough, he said that he had decided to read everything that had been written about Paul. He began on one end of the relevant shelf in the library stacks, only to realize very soon that new books were being added on the other end faster than he could read through the works already written.</p><br><p>This was almost the case with the history of women in the church. My intention has been to distill and meld my own research with the results of other historians&#x2019; research and produce women&#x2019;s 2,000-year story. Most of the research already completed has been necessarily restricted to one woman, or one community or denomination, or one time period or geographical location, and I believe that the whole story needs to be told to present a picture of all the women&#x2019;s work that has been undertaken. But I must apologize where I have had to omit some findings. There are so many studies. Dozens of female and male theologians and historians have produced innumerable works, most of it excellent, but it has not been possible to include everything that has been written in the number of pages allotted to this book. There is also the problem of hagiographical studies; much of that information is unfortunately suspect or at least lacking in human detail.</p><br><p>Since histories in the past have almost totally excluded women&#x2014;half the adult population&#x2014;it may seem fair and timely today to write a history of only women. But there are some dangers with this approach. First, it may give the impression that women have achieved more than they actually have, and that they were not as restricted as they often were. And second, there is the problem of bias and lack of objectivity. When I taught courses on women&#x2019;s history, I always began by stating that the course was totally objective. Never having been challenged on this point, I then had to confess that I believe there is no such thing as total objectivity. We are all biased to a degree, depending on our upbringing, where we&#x2019;ve gone to school, what we&#x2019;ve read, where we&#x2019;ve lived, what churches we&#x2019;ve attended, what our parents have taught us, and so on. But the important point is to know and acknowledge one&#x2019;s bias. My bias will probably become apparent as you read this story, although I have attempted to present different sides of various issues. I hope that you as a reader will understand and acknowledge your own bias. As my koin� or biblical Greek professor said to us once, &#x201c;There are three Truths. My Truth, Your Truth, and The Truth.&#x201d; Simple perhaps, yet very profound, a dictum that could have avoided much of the violence, sexism, and discrimination that you will read about on the following pages if ecclesiastics and politicians had accepted this reality.</p><br><p>The next step, of course, is for a future historian to integrate all the following chapters into a complete history with equal attention paid to both men and women. There is also a need for an up-to-date history of feminist theology; and perhaps another historian could research LGBTQ members throughout the history of the Christian Church. This particular study, however, remains a history of female leadership, as much as can be recorded in the assigned number of pages.</p><br><p>One further note: As historians are aware, the way names are spelled and dates recorded varies tremendously over the centuries and even during a person&#x2019;s lifetime, sometimes even in the same document. Thus you may find discrepancies in spelling and dates on the following pages compared with what you may have read elsewhere.</p><br><p>May you applaud the many strong, determined, and extraordinary religiously affiliated women described in the ensuing chapters, whatever your bias or your belief.<br></p></p><h2>Counselling Children: A Practical Introduction</h2><p><p>The definitive guide to the skills and techniques used when working with children experiencing emotional problems, this book covers all you need to know about, including:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>The goals for counseling children and the child-counselor relationship</li> <li>Practice frameworks for working effectively with children</li> <li>Play therapy and the use of different media and activities</li> <li>Building self-esteem and social skills through the use of worksheets</li> </ul> <p>The new <strong>Fifth Edition</strong> has been updated to include:</p> <ul> <li>A new chapter on technology (its influence on children and ways that technology can be used during counseling)</li> <li>New content on issues of diversity and difference in counseling children</li> <li>The different contexts in which counseling children occur</li> <li>Discussion of concepts of well-being and resilience</li> <li>Updated references and research</li> </ul> <p>The book is supported by a new<strong>&nbsp;C<strong>ompanion Website&nbsp;</strong></strong>that provides training materials and handouts on a range of skills for counseling children including:&nbsp;helping the child to tell their story&nbsp;and tray work, the use of miniature animals, the use of clay, and helping the child to change thoughts and behavior.<br> <br> This highly practical guide is vital reading for counselors, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, nurses, and teachers working or training to work with children.</p></p><p>KATHRYN GELDARD, PhD, is a lecturer and counsellor supervisor in the School of Psychology and Counselling at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia.

It features solutions to selected problems, with separate sections and appendices that cover more technical applications.<br>Each chapter is self-contained and features an introduction that identifies its basic goals, their significance, and a general plan for their achievement. This text's important aims are to demonstrate that the basic kinetic principles are essential to the solution of modern chemical problems, and to show how the underlying question &#x2014; "How do chemical reactions occur?" &#x2014; leads to exciting, vibrant fields of modern research. The first aim is achieved by using relevant examples in presenting the basic material, and the second is attained by inclusion of chapters on surface processes, photochemistry, and reaction dynamics.</p><p>Chairman, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology</p><h2>The Gamma Function (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>This brief monograph on the gamma function was designed by the author to fill what he perceived as a gap in the literature of mathematics, which often treated the gamma function in a manner he described as both sketchy and overly complicated. Author Emil Artin, one of the twentieth century's leading mathematicians, wrote in his Preface to this book, "I feel that this monograph will help to show that the gamma function can be thought of as one of the elementary functions, and that all of its basic properties can be established using elementary methods of the calculus." <br>Generations of teachers and students have benefitted from Artin's masterly arguments and precise results. Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students of mathematics, his treatment examines functions, the Euler integrals and the Gauss formula, large values of <i>x</i> and the multiplication formula, the connection with sin <i>x,</i> applications to definite integrals, and other subjects.</p><p><p>One of the 20th century's most prominent mathematicians, Emil Artin (1898&#x2013;1962) taught at the University of Hamburg from 1923 to 1937.

Leading authority Edward S. Shapiro provides practical strategies for working with students across all grade levels (K&#x2013;12) who are struggling with reading, spelling, written language, or math. Step-by-step guidelines are detailed for assessing students' learning and their instructional environment, using the data to design instructional modifications, and monitoring student progress. The research base for the approach is accessibly summarized. The companion workbook, available separately, contains practice exercises and reproducible forms.</p><p><p>Edward S. Shapiro, PhD, until his death in 2016, was Director of the Center for Promoting Research to Practice and Professor in the School Psychology Program at Lehigh University. Best known for his work in curriculum-based assessment and nonstandardized methods of assessing academic skills problems, Dr. Shapiro was author or coauthor of numerous books. He also developed the widely used BOSS (Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools) software system and presented papers, chaired symposia, and delivered invited addresses at conferences around the world. Dr. Shapiro's contributions to the field of school psychology have been recognized with the Outstanding Contributions to Training Award from Trainers of School Psychologists, the Distinguished Contribution to School Psychology Award from the Pennsylvania Psychological Association, the Eleanor and Joseph Lipsch Research Award from Lehigh University, and the Senior Scientist Award from the Division of School Psychology of the American Psychological Association, among other honors.</p>"Long a standard in the field, this book will continue to serve as a seminal text. With updated chapters on assessing instructional placement and providing instructional modification and a new chapter on RTI, the fourth edition belongs on the shelf of any practitioner who desires to more fully understand direct academic assessment and RTI."--John M. Hintze, PhD, Professor and Director, School Psychology Program, University of Massachusetts-Amherst<br>&nbsp;<br>"An essential resource for school psychologists. The fourth edition of <i>Academic Skills Problems</i> and the companion workbook update the core features of previous editions within a contemporary multi-tiered format. Shapiro has provided an excellent reference on curriculum-based assessment, measurement, and evaluation, as well as formal classroom observation techniques. He not only describes how to assess student difficulties, but also offers ample intervention guidance. This text will work well in a number of courses related to the training of school psychologists; I personally will use it in my course on Instructional Consultation."--Joseph F. Kovaleski, DEd, Director, Doctoral Program in School Psychology, Indiana University of Pennsylvania<br>&nbsp;<br>[practitioner quote]<br>"This essential reference provides a synthesis of cutting-edge research and offers pragmatic, practitioner-oriented guidance relevant to each and every member of a school&#x2019;s problem-solving team. The fourth edition continues to be unique in its comprehensive approach to teasing apart the utility and implementation of various assessment methods and linking identified skills problems to simple yet highly effective interventions. Of particular relevance today is the focus on data analysis and interpretation in the context of response to intervention (RTI) frameworks. Given the critical need for administering technically adequate RTI assessment practices with fidelity, <i>Academic Skills Problems, Fourth Edition</i><i>,</i> and the accompanying workbook are invaluable as tools for both preservice training and staff professional development."--Laura Lent, EdS, NCSP, staff development and training specialist, Lancaster-Lebanon Intermediate Unit 13, Pennsylvania</p><h2>Medicine PreTest Self-Assessment and Review, Fourteenth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The closest you can get to seeing the USMLE Step 2 CK without actually taking it</b></p><p><i>Medicine: PreTest Self-Assessment &amp; Review</i> is the perfect way for you to assess your knowledge of medicine/internal medicine for the USMLE Step 2 CK and shelf exams.

In this her latest collection of essays she explores the story-telling impulse, and asks how she, as a &#x2018;product of postmodernism&#x2019;, can reconnect to the primal act of making meaning and telling stories. She also asks how theatre practitioners can think of themselves not as stagers of plays but &#x2018;orchestrators of social interactions&#x2019; and participants in an on-going dialogue about the future. </p> <p><em>We dream. And then occasionally we attempt to share our dreams with others. In recounting our dreams we try to construct a narrative... We also make stories out of our daytime existence.

We can choose to relate to our circumstances with bitterness or with openness. The stories that we tell determine nothing less than personal destiny</em>.

Or is China helping the developing world pave a pathway out of poverty, as the Chinese claim? In the last few years, China&#39;s aid program has leapt out of the shadows. Media reports about huge aid packages, support for pariah regimes, regiments of Chinese labor, and the ruthless exploitation of workers and natural resources in some of the poorest countries in the world sparked fierce debates. These debates, however, took place with very few hard facts. China&#39;s tradition of secrecy about its aid fueled rumors and speculation, making it difficult to gauge the risks and opportunities provided by China&#39;s growing embrace. This well-timed book, by one of the world&#39;s leading experts, provides the first comprehensive account of China&#39;s aid and economic cooperation overseas. Deborah Brautigam tackles the myths and realities, explaining what the Chinese are doing, how they do it, how much aid they give, and how it all fits into their &#34;going global&#34; strategy. Drawing on three decades of experience in China and Africa, and hundreds of interviews in Africa, China, Europe and the US, Brautigam shines new light on a topic of great interest. China has ended poverty for hundreds of millions of its own citizens. Will Chinese engagement benefit Africa? Using hard data and a series of vivid stories ranging across agriculture, industry, natural resources, and governance, Brautigam&#39;s fascinating book provides an answer. It is essential reading for anyone concerned with China&#39;s rise, and what it might mean for the challenge of ending poverty in Africa.</p><p><br><strong>Deborah Brautigam</strong> is the author of <em>Chinese Aid and African Development</em> (1998), <em>Aid Dependence and Governance</em> (2000), and coeditor of <em>Taxation and State-Building in Developing Countries</em> (2008).

She is a professor in the International Development Program at American University's School of International Service in Washington, DC.<br><br>"<em>The Dragon's Gift</em> looks behind [the] media hype. It offers surprising insights and challenges us to take a new look at Africa's development.... thoughtful and well-researched...the basis for a well-informed, interesting dialogue with Chinese actors." --<em>The Huffington Post</em> <br><p></p><br>"Brautigam's lively and thoroughly documented account buck[s] the conventional wisdom."--<em>Foreign Affairs</em> <br><p></p><br>"Deborah Brautigam's superb book <em>The Dragon's Gift</em> offers a window into how China's foray into Africa is playing out on the ground. Rich in vivid anecdotes and informed by the author's three decades of academic work on both China and Africa, the book does many things, and does them all well. It describes how Chinese engagement in Africa has evolved, identifies its drivers, and assays its emerging impact on both economics and governance in nearly two dozen African states. It also looks behind the noble-minded rhetoric to the realities of aid-giving--Western as well as Chinese. The result is a fresh and compelling assessment of China in Africa..." --<em>The American Interest</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Dragon's Gift</em>'s strength is its extensive and varied array of interviews with Chinese government officials in Africa, Chinese factory managers, and other Chinese, African, and third-country participants and observers. Through these interviews, she conveys a rich sense of Chinese perceptions of how their own experience could benefit African countries." --<em>Finance &amp; Development</em> <br><p></p><br>"Now comes a timely book by American academic Deborah Brautigam, an observer of Africa and Asia for three decades, which uses personal experiences combined with powerful research to puncture myths and fears that cloud understanding of one of the most important geopolitical shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall."--<em>The Independent</em> <br><p></p><br>"Stands as the key booklength analysis on the subject. ...<em>The Dragons Gift</em> will be for a long time be the lodestone of informed discussion of how China and Chinese interact with Africa and Africans." --<em>China Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"The best book so far on the developmental implications of China's engagement with Africa. Brautigam has done an excellent job in bringing together existing work on the topic and also first-class field research. As a result, the volume offers a more nuanced understanding of Beijings policies than many other previous books on the subject.... Anyone interested in Sino-African ties needs to read this book." --<em>Perspectives on Politics</em> <br><p></p><br>"The book tells a sweeping tale of Chinas engagement in Africa since the early 1950s, providing an important reminder that the recent trends in Sino-African relations have not turned up out of the blue (as alarmist media reports often portray) but rather have a significant history....particularly strong in addressing the question of what the Chinese are doing in their new wave of aid and economic cooperation across Africa....a superbly written and exquisitely researched book on a hotly debated topic." --<em>Economic Record</em> <br><p></p><br>"If you want to know what China is really doing in Africa, this is the one book to read. <em>The Dragon's Gift</em> corrects the misinformation of both critics and defenders of Chinas role on the continent. Beijing has a long-term, well-planned strategy that goes way beyond a drive to claim minerals and oil. Yet Africans are benefiting from Chinas mixture of aid and investment; Western aid officials could learn from it. I was surprised by new facts on almost every page. Brautigam has given us a compelling, objective, and very readable account enlivened by her personal experiences and interviews."--Susan Shirk, author of <em>China: Fragile Superpower</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Dragon's Gift</em> is a path-breaking book, one that was urgently needed and one which deserves to be widely noticed and read. It not only provides an in-depth analysis of contemporary relations of China with Africa, located within their proper historical context, but meticulously presents, critiques and successfully challenges the array of myths, fears, and misinformation which abound in both press reports and some academic studies of China in Africa." --Roger C. Riddell, author of <em>Does Foreign Aid Really Work?</em> <br><p></p><br>"For China's cash-rich and nimbly opportunistic corporate sector, in particular, what Africa represents can be summed up quite neatly: the future. Deborah Brautigam, the author of <em>The Dragon's Gift: The Real Story of China in Africa,</em> understands all of this far better than most who have written on this subject. Her richly detailed book has many technical merits, but its greatest strength may in fact be her understanding of this psychological dynamic.... The universe of third-party experts who are deeply familiar with both China and Africa is vanishingly small, and Brautigam is easily one of the best qualified members of this select tribe." --Howard French, <em>The National</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Dragon's Gift</em> is a welcome addition for general readers on why some fears are overblown and others are exaggerations of inaccuracies... This book offers many new insights into what Africa may truly want or need and how China sees itself... [and it] is an outstanding addition to resources easily readable by the general public; with a wide-range of cross application whether the reader is interested in China, economics, Africa or the humanitarian aspects of aid." --<em>International Public Management Review</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Elements of Library Research: What Every Student Needs to Know</h2><p><p>To do solid academic research, college students need to look beyond the computer search engine.

The authors present an evidence-based portrait of key features of the authoritarian landscape with newly collected data about 200 dictatorial regimes. They examine the central political processes that shape the policy choices of dictatorships and how they compel reaction from policy makers in the rest of the world. Importantly, this book explains how some dictators concentrate great power in their own hands at the expense of other members of the dictatorial elite. Dictators who can monopolize decision making in their countries cause much of the erratic, warlike behavior that disturbs the rest of the world. By providing a picture of the central processes common to dictatorships, this book puts the experience of specific countries in perspective, leading to an informed understanding of events and the likely outcome of foreign responses to autocracies.</p><p>This book gives readers a better understanding of contemporary dictatorships and the policy implications of political struggles that occur in them.

Her 1999 article in the Annual Review of Political Science is credited with changing the way social scientists think about dictatorships. She developed the theoretical reasons for using characteristics of the group that established the dictatorship as the basis for explaining dictatorial decisions and began the first systematic collection of data about these groups and the dictatorships they initiated. She has written extensively on regime transition and dictatorship, as well as research design in comparative politics.</p><h2>Effective Group Coaching: Tried and Tested Tools and Resources for Optimum Coaching Results</h2><p>Group coaching is rapidly becoming the preferred coaching option for businesses and individuals. <i>Effective Group Coaching</i> is a practical, resource rich, hands-on guide for the group coaching facilitator in one of the fastest growing new disciplines.

A long, white, mausoleum-like structure, the building is named after Marriner Eccles, who chaired the Board from November 1934 until April 1948. These were crucial years in the history of the American economy, and the world&#x2019;s.<br><br>While Eccles is largely forgotten today, he offered critical insight into the great pendulum of American capitalism. His analysis of the underlying economic stresses of the Great Depression is extraordinarily, even eerily, relevant to the Crash of 2008. It also offers if not a blueprint for the future, at least a suggestion of what to expect in the coming years.<br><br>A small, slender man with dark eyes and a pale, sharp face, Eccles was born in Logan, Utah, in 1890. His father, David Eccles, a poor Mormon immigrant from Glasgow, Scotland, had come to Utah, married two women, became a businessman, and made a fortune. Young Marriner, one of David&#x2019;s twenty-one children, trudged off to Scotland at the start of 1910 as a Mormon missionary but returned home two years later to become a bank president. By age twenty-four he was a millionaire; by forty he was a tycoon&#x2014;director of railroad, hotel, and insurance companies; head of a bank holding company controlling twenty-six banks; and president of lumber, milk, sugar, and construction companies spanning the Rockies to the Sierra Nevadas.<br><br>In the Crash of 1929, his businesses were sufficiently diverse and his banks adequately capitalized that he stayed afloat financially. But he was deeply shaken when his assumption that the economy would quickly return to normal was, as we know, proved incorrect. &#x201c;Men I respected assured me that the economic crisis was only temporary,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;and that soon all the things that had pulled the country out of previous depressions would operate to that same end once again. But weeks turned to months. The months turned to a year or more. Instead of easing, the economic crisis worsened.&#x201d; He himself had come to realize by late 1930 that something was profoundly wrong, not just with the economy but with his own understanding of it. &#x201c;I awoke to find myself at the bottom of a pit without any known means of scaling its sheer sides. . . . I saw for the first time that though I&#x2019;d been active in the world of finance and production for seventeen years and knew its techniques, I knew less than nothing about its economic and social effects.&#x201d; Everyone who relied on him&#x2014;family, friends, business associates, the communities that depended on the businesses he ran&#x2014;expected him to find a way out of the pit. &#x201c;Yet all I could find within myself was despair.&#x201d;<br><br>When Eccles&#x2019;s anxious bank depositors began demanding their money, he called in loans and reduced credit in order to shore up the banks&#x2019; reserves. But the reduced lending caused further economic harm. Small businesses couldn&#x2019;t get the loans they needed to stay alive. In spite of his actions, Eccles had nagging concerns that by tightening credit instead of easing it, he and other bankers were saving their banks at the expense of community&#x2014;in &#x201c;seeking individual salvation, we were contributing to collective ruin.&#x201d;<br><br>Economists and the leaders of business and Wall Street&#x2014;including financier Bernard Baruch; W. W. Atterbury, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad; and Myron Taylor, chairman of the United States Steel Corporation&#x2014;sought to reassure the country that the market would correct itself automatically, and that the government&#x2019;s only responsibility was to balance the federal budget. Lower prices and interest rates, they said, would inevitably &#x201c;lure &#x2018;natural new investments&#x2019; by men who still had money and credit and whose revived activity would produce an upswing in the economy.&#x201d; Entrepreneurs would put their money into new technologies that would lead the way to prosperity. But Eccles wondered why anyone would invest when the economy was so severely disabled. Such investments, he reasoned, &#x201c;take place in a climate of high prosperity, when the purchasing power of the masses increases their demands for a higher standard of living and enables them to purchase more than their bare wants. In the America of the thirties what hope was there for developments on the technological frontier when millions of our people hadn&#x2019;t enough purchasing power for even their barest needs?&#x201d;<br><br>There was a more elaborate and purportedly &#x201c;ethical&#x201d; argument offered by those who said nothing could be done. Many of those business leaders and economists of the day believed &#x201c;a depression was the scientific operation of economic laws that were God-given and not man-made. They could not be interfered with.&#x201d; They said depressions were phenomena like the one described in the biblical story of Joseph and the seven kine, in which Pharaoh dreamed of seven bountiful years followed by seven years of famine, and that America was now experiencing the lean years that inevitably followed the full ones. Eccles wrote, &#x201c;They further explained that we were in the lean years because we had been spendthrifts and wastrels in the roaring twenties. We had wasted what we earned instead of saving it. We had enormously inflated values. But in time we would sober up and the economy would right itself through the action of men who had been prudent and thrifty all along, who had saved their money and at the right time would reinvest it in new production. Then the famine would end.&#x201d;<br><br>Eccles thought this was nonsense. A devout Mormon, he saw that what passed for the God-given operation of economics &#x201c;was nothing more than a determination of this or that interest, specially favored by the status quo, to resist any new rules that might be to their disadvantage.&#x201d; He wrote, &#x201c;It became apparent to me, as a capitalist, that if I lent myself to this sort of action and resisted any change designed to benefit all the people, I could be consumed by the poisons of social lag I had helped create.&#x201d; Eccles also saw that &#x201c;men with great economic power had an undue influence in making the rules of the economic game, in shaping the actions of government that enforced those rules, and in conditioning the attitude taken by people as a whole toward those rules. After I had lost faith in my business heroes, I concluded that I and everyone else had an equal right to share in the process by which economic rules are made and changed.&#x201d; One of the country&#x2019;s most powerful economic leaders concluded that the economic game was not being played on a level field. It was tilted in favor of those with the most wealth and power.<br>Eccles made his national public debut before the Senate Finance Committee in February 1933, just weeks before Franklin D. Roosevelt was sworn in as president. The committee was holding hearings on what, if anything, should be done to deal with the ongoing economic crisis. Others had advised reducing the national debt and balancing the federal budget, but Eccles had different advice. Anticipating what British economist John Maynard Keynes would counsel three years later in his famous <i>General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i>, Eccles told the senators that the government had to go deeper into debt in order to offset the lack of spending by consumers and businesses. Eccles went further. He advised the senators on ways to get more money into the hands of the beleaguered middle class. He offered a precise program designed &#x201c;to bring about, by Government action, an increase of purchasing power on the part of all the people.&#x201d;<br><br>Eccles arrived at these ideas not by any temperamental or cultural affinity&#x2014;he was, after all, a banker and of Scottish descent&#x2014;but by logic and experience. He understood the economy from the ground up. He saw how average people responded to economic downturns, and how his customers reacted to the deep crisis at hand. He merely connected the dots. His proposed program included relief for the unemployed, government spending on public works, government refinancing of mortgages, a federal minimum wage, federally supported old-age pensions, and higher income taxes and inheritance taxes on the wealthy in order to control capital accumulations and avoid excessive speculation. Not until these recommendations were implemented, Eccles warned, could the economy be fully restored.<br><br>Eccles then returned to Utah, from where he watched Roosevelt hatch the first hundred days of his presidency. To Eccles, the new president&#x2019;s initiatives seemed barely distinguishable from what his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, had offered&#x2014;a hodgepodge of ideas cooked up by Wall Street to keep it afloat but do little for anyone else. &#x201c;New York, as usual, seems to be in the saddle, dominating fiscal and monetary policy,&#x201d; he wrote to his friend George Dern, the former governor of Utah who had become Roosevelt&#x2019;s secretary of war.<br><br>In mid-December 1933, Eccles received a telegram from Roosevelt&#x2019;s Treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau, Jr., asking him to return to Washington at the earliest possible date to &#x201c;talk about monetary matters.&#x201d; Eccles was perplexed. The new administration had shown no interest in his ideas. He had never met Morgenthau, who was a strong advocate for balancing the federal budget. After their meeting, the mystery only deepened. Morgenthau asked Eccles to write a report on monetary policy, which Eccles could as easily have written in Utah. A few days later Morgenthau invited Eccles to his home, where he asked about Eccles&#x2019;s business connections, his personal finances, and the condition of his businesses, namely whether any had gone bankrupt. Finally, Morgenthau took Eccles into his confidence. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been recommended as someone I should get to help me in the Treasury Department,&#x201d; Morgenthau said. Eccles was taken aback, and asked for a few days to think about it.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Here you are, Marriner, full of talk about what the government should and shouldn&#x2019;t do,&#x2019;&#x201d; Eccles told himself, as he later recounted in his memoirs. &#x201c;&#x2018;You ought to put up or shut up. . . . You&#x2019;re afraid your theory won&#x2019;t work. You&#x2019;re afraid you&#x2019;ll be a damned fool. You want to stick it out in Utah and wear the hair shirt of a prophet crying in the wilderness. You can feel noble that way, and you run no risks. [But] if you don&#x2019;t come here you&#x2019;ll probably regret it for the rest of your life.&#x2019;&#x201d; Eccles talked himself into the job.<br><br>For many months thereafter, Eccles steeped himself in the work of the Treasury and the Roosevelt administration, pushing his case for why the government needed to go deeper into debt to prop up the economy, and what it needed to do for average people. Apparently he made progress. Roosevelt&#x2019;s budget of 1934 contained many of Eccles&#x2019;s ideas, violating the president&#x2019;s previous promise to balance the federal budget. The president &#x201c;swallowed the violation with considerable difficulty,&#x201d; Eccles wrote.<br><br>The following summer, after the governor of the Federal Reserve Board unexpectedly resigned, Morgenthau recommend-ed Eccles for the job. Eccles had not thought about the Fed as a vehicle for advancing his ideas. But a few weeks later, when the president summoned him to the White House to ask if he&#x2019;d be interested, Eccles told Roosevelt he&#x2019;d take the job if the Federal Reserve in Washington had more power over the supply of money, and the New York Fed (dominated by Wall Street bankers), less. Eccles knew Wall Street wanted a tight money supply and correspondingly high interest rates, but the Main Streets of America&#x2014;the real economy&#x2014;needed a loose money supply and low rates. Roosevelt agreed to support new legislation that would tip the scales toward Main Street. Eccles took over the Fed.<br><br>For the next fourteen years, with great vigor and continuing vigilance for the welfare of average people, Eccles helped steer the economy through the remainder of the Depression and through World War II. He would also become one of the architects of the Great Prosperity that the nation and much of the rest of the world enjoyed after the war.</p><h2>Women Living Well</h2><p><p>Women desire to live well.

In this bracing book, Garrett Hardin offers a plan for clear thinking about these dangers. He shows how the filters of <i>literacy, </i>understanding what words really mean; <i>numeracy,</i> being able to quantify and interpret information; and <i>ecolacy, </i>assessment of complex interactions over time, can allow anyone to make sensible judgments about ecological issues--even in the face of a barrage of confusing expertise. <br><br> "<i>Filters Against Folly</i> offers an antidote to some of the more perverse and dangerous irrationalities of our time: wishful self-delusion, educated incapacity, and foolhardy optimism...If ever this book were needed, it is needed today." -- Lynton K. Caldwell, School of Public Environmental Affairs, Indiana University</p><p><b>Garrett Hardin </b>(1915-2003) was a renowned ecologist and philosopher who warned societies about both overpopulation and excessive consumption.

Former chatterboxes answer in monosyllables; freethinkers mimic everything from clothes to opinions. Their bodies and psyches morph through the most radical changes since infancy. They are kids in the middle-school years, the age every adult remembers well enough to dread.<br><br>Here at last is an up-to-date anthropology of this critically formative period. Prize-winning education reporter Linda Perlstein spent a year immersed in the lunchroom, classrooms, hearts, and minds of a group of suburban Maryland middle schoolers and emerged with this pathbreaking account. Perlstein reveals what&#x2019;s really going on under kids&#x2019; don&#x2019;t-touch-me facade while they grapple with schoolwork, puberty, romance, and identity. A must-read for parents and educators, <i>Not Much Just Chillin&#x2019;</i> offers a trail map to the baffling no-man&#x2019;s-land between child and teen.</p><p><b>Linda Perlstein</b> was a prizewinning education reporter for <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i>. She is the author of <i>Not Much Just Chillin&#x2019;</i>.&nbsp;She lives in Washington, D.C.In contrast to the recent spate of books that focus on bullying (e.g., Rosalind Wiseman's Queen Bees and Wannabees and Rachel Simmons's Odd Girl Out), Washington Post education reporter Perlstein examines all facets of being an ordinary "tween." She discusses such issues as consumerism (according to Perlstein, 12- to 15-year-olds spend on average $59 a week, not counting money their parents spend on them); romance, which doesn't necessarily imply the couple ever spends time alone together; and the phenomenon of instant messaging-all to give parents of young children an idea of what lies ahead. True, much can be learned from reading catalogues and magazines geared specifically to preteens, like Delia's catalogue, CosmoGIRL! and YM, but Perlstein delves deeper into how boys and girls view life by tracking five students at Wilde Lake Middle School in Columbia, Md., a "rough" suburban school in an affluent area. Her subjects include the likable eighth-grader Eric Ellis, who is very bright and very bored, and seventh-graders Jackie Taylor, who is learning to deal with crushes on boys, and Elizabeth Ginsburg, whose favorite answer to her parents' questions is "nothing." There are also sixth-graders Jimmy Schissel, who is unhappy with his changing body, and Lily Mason, who worries about wearing-and doing-the right thing. In addition to details about the children's confirmations, bat mitzvahs, friendships and homework, Perlstein interweaves information about how middle-school children learn best and what parents can do to help.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The French for Always</h2><p><p><b>Five weddings.

However, it never gained as prominent a position in the Tibetan tradition as it had held in Sanskrit or in the Chinese Buddhist tradition. For this reason, this translation, which contains resources from the Indian, Tibetan, and Chinese traditions, is especially helpful. The inclusion of Chinese materials is particularly valuable as it was in China that the text spread most widely and had the greatest influence.

Karl Brunnh�lzl not only provides reliable translations of the&nbsp;<i>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;nasamgraha</i>&nbsp;and its major commentaries, a long-standing desideratum in the field, he also offers twenty substantive appendices that illuminate difficult issues in Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra theory, such as the&nbsp;<i>&#x101;layavij�&#x101;na</i>&nbsp;and its seeds (<i>b&#x12b;ja</i>), the concept of mere cognizance (<i>vij�aptim&#x101;tra</i>), and evolving treatments of the Three Natures. Even more important is the sustained argument, based on this thorough study of the relevant textual sources, that classical Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra did&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;postulate mind or consciousness as a truly existing entity, but rather used its critical analyzes of cognitive construction to explain how delusion arises and is then remedied on the path to awakening. This study thus provides a historically contextualized interpretation of Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra that challenges the largely ahistorical doxographical models&#x2014;the &#x2018;received tradition&#x2019; accepted in India, Tibet, and most Western circles&#x2014;that have long characterized Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra as a form of metaphysical idealism. This work could hardly be more timely. We must applaud Karl Brunnh�lzl for once again offering students of mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhist thought a treasure trove of crucial texts, cogent interpretations, and focused appendices." &#x2014;William S. Waldron, Professor of Religion, Middlebury College<br><br>"Brunnh�lzl&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>A Compendium of the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na</i>&nbsp;is a remarkable achievement. More than a splendid translation of the&nbsp;<i>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;nasamgraha&nbsp;</i>along with its commentaries and numerous related texts, these volumes serve as a detailed and comprehensive primer on mah&#x101;y&#x101;na theory and practice, especially as viewed by Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra, one of the two Indian mah&#x101;y&#x101;na schools. It is clearly written so that it is accessible to serious novices and practitioners, and rich in details that will satisfy and instruct scholars. The&nbsp;<i>Mah&#x101;y&#x101;nasamgraha</i>&nbsp;has been influential in India, East Asia, and Tibet, and now its treasures along with the contexts that help unlock its depths are available in an English edition that will remain the standard work for many years to come." &#x2014;Dan Lusthaus, Research Associate, Harvard University</p><h2>The King&#39;s Justice (A Stanton and Barling Mystery, 1)</h2><p><p><b>A murder that defies logic&#x2014;and a killer on the loose.</b></p><p>England, 1176.

Well, there's an odd question, and I've been asking it meself for the past fifty years. I can tell you how I got here and what happened to me. But why? Now that's a mystery.</p> <p>It's a deep, smoke-filled voice, with a strong East London accent, and you can hear the smile in it, as if she's about to break into an asthmatic chuckle at any moment.</p> <p>They've probably warned you about me, told you my story is all made up. At least that's what those trick-cyclists would have you believe.</p> <p>Another voice, with the carefully modulated, well-educated tones of a younger woman: "Trick-cyclist?"</p> <p>Sorry, dearie, it's what we used to call the psychiatrist, in them old days. Anyway, he used to say that telling tales-he calls them fantasies-is a response to some "ungratified need."</p> <p>"You're not wrong there," I'd tell him, giving him the old eyelash flutter. "I've been stuck in here most of me life. I've got plenty of ungratified needs." But he'd just smile and say, "You need to concentrate on getting better, my dear, look forward, not backward, all the time. Repeating and reinforcing these fantasies is just regressive behavior, and it really must stop, or we'll never get you out of here."</p> <p>Well, you can take it or leave it, dearie, but I have to tell it.</p> <p>"And I would very much like to hear it. That's what I'm here for."</p> <p>That's very kind of you, my dear. You see, when you've been hidden away from real life for so many years, what else is there to do but remember the times when you were young, when you were meeting new people every day, when you were allowed to have feelings, when you were alive? Nothing. Except for me needlework and other creations, they were the only things that would give me a bit of comfort. So I tell my story to anyone who will listen, and I don't care if they call me a fantasist. Remembering him, and the child I lost, is the only way I could hold onto reality.</p> <p>So, where do you want me to start?</p> <p>"At the beginning would be fine. The tape is running now."</p> <p>You'll have to bear with me, dearie. It'll take some remembering, it was that long ago. I turned seventy-four this year so the old brain cells are not what they used to be. Still, I'll give it a try. You don't mind if I carry on with me sewing while I talk, do you? It helps me concentrate and relax. I'm never happy without a needle in my fingers. It's just a bit of appliqu� with a buttonhole stitch-quite straightforward. Stops the fabric fraying, you see?</p> <p>She is caught by a spasm of coughing, a deep, rattling smoker's cough.</p> <p>Hrrrm. That's better. Okay, here we go then.</p> <p>***</p> <p>My name is Maria Romano, and I believe my mother was originally from Rome, though what she was doing leaving that beautiful sunny place for the dreary old East End of London is a mystery. Do they all grow small, the people who live in Italy? Mum was tiny, so they said, and I've never been more than five foot at the best of times. These days I've probably shrunk to less. If you're that size, you don't have a cat's chance of winning a fight, so you learn to be quick on your feet-that's me. I used to love dancing whenever I had the chance, which wasn't often, and I could run like the wind. But there have been some things in my life even I couldn't run away from-this place being one of them.</p> <p>The strange thing is that after all those years of longing to get out, once we was allowed to do what we liked, we always wanted to come back-it felt safe and my friends were here. It was my home. When they started talking about sending us all away to live in houses, it made me frightened just to imagine it, and if it was worrying me, what must it have been like for the real crazies? How do they ever cope outside? You're a socio-wotsit, aren't you? What do you think?</p> <p>"I'm happy to talk about that later, if you like, but we're here to talk about you. So please carry on."</p> <p>I will if you insist, though I can't for the life of me imagine what you find so interesting in a little old lady. What was I talking about?</p> <p>"Your mother?"</p> <p>Ah yes, me poor mum. Another reason to believe she was Italian is my coloring. I'm all gray now, faded to nothing, but my skin used to go so dark in summer, they said I must have a touch of the tar brush, and my shiny black curls were the envy of all the girls at the orphanage. Nora told me the boys thought I was quite a looker, and I learned to flash my big brown eyes at them to make them blush and to watch their glances slip sideways.</p> <p>"The orphanage?"</p> <p>Ah yes, Mum died when I was just a babe, only about two years old I was, poor little mite. Not sure what she died of, but there was all kinds of diseases back then in them poor parts of the city, and no doctors to speak of, not for our kind, at least. They hadn't come up with antibiotics or vaccinations, nothing like that-hard to believe now, but I'm talking about the really old days, turn of the century times.</p> <p>I never heard tell of any grandparents, and after he'd had his fun, my father disappeared off the scene as far as I knew, so when she died, I ended up at The Castle-well, that's what we called it because the place was so huge and gloomy and it had pointy windows and those whatchamacall-ums, them zigzaggy patterns around the top of the walls where the roof should be.</p> <p>"Castellations?"</p> <p>It was certainly a fortress, with high iron gates and brick walls all around. To keep dangerous people out, they told us-this was the East End of London after all-but we knew it was really to stop us lot running away. There was no garden as such, no trees or flowers, just a paved yard we could play in when the weather was good.</p> <p>Inside was all dark wood and stone floors and great wide stairways reaching up three or four stories; to my little legs, it felt like we was climbing up to heaven each time we went to bed. It sounds a bit tragic when I tell it, but I don't remember ever feeling unhappy there. I knew no different. It was warm, the food was good, and I had plenty of company-some of them became true friends.</p> <p>The nuns was terrifying to us littl'uns at first, in their long black tunics with sleeves that flared out like bat's wings when they ran along the corridors chasing and chastising us. Most of 'em was kindly even though some could get crotchety at times. No surprise really, with no men in their lives, and just a load of naughty children.</p> <p>It was a better start in life than I'd have had with my poor mum, I'll warrant. Pity it didn't turn out like that in the end.</p> <p>Anyway, the nuns' sole aim in life was to teach us little monsters good manners and basic reading and writing, as well as skills like cooking, housework, and needlework so we could go into service when we came of an age, which is exactly what happened to me. I 'specially loved needlework. I was good at it, and I loved the attention it give me.</p> <p>"It's a gift from God," the nuns would say, but I didn't believe that. It was just 'cause I had tiny fingers, and I took more trouble than the others and learned to do it properly. We had all the time in the world, after all.</p> <p>D'you do any sewing, Miss?</p> <p>"Not really. I'm more of a words person."</p> <p>You should give it a try. There's nothing more satisfying than starting with a plain old piece of wool blanket that no one else wants and ending up with a beautiful coat that'll keep a child warm through many a winter. Or to quilt up scraps of cotton patchwork to make a comfy bed cover that ain't scratchy and makes the room look pretty besides.</p> <p>The needlework room at The Castle had long cutting tables and tall windows set so high you couldn't see out of them, and that was where we spent most of our days. In winter, we'd huddle by the old stove in the corner, and in summer, we'd spread out around the room in gaggles so that we could gossip away from those nuns' ears, which was sharp as pins.</p> <p>It was all handstitching, mind, no sewing machines in those days, of course. And by the time I was ten, I knew what needle to use with which fabrics and what kind of thread, and I could do a dozen types of stitch, from simple running stitch and back stitching, to fancy embroidery like wheatear and French knots, and I loved to do them as perfect and even as possible so you could hardly tell a human hand had made them. Sister Mary was a good teacher and loved her subject, and I suppose she passed her enthusiasm on to us, so before long, I could name any fabric with my eyes closed just by the feel, tell the difference between crepe and cambric, galatea and gingham, kersey and linsey-woolsey, velvet and velvetine, and which was best for which job.</p> <p>Not that we saw a lot of fine fabrics, mind. It was mostly plain wool and cotton, much of it secondhand that we had to reclaim from used garments and furnishings. But on occasions, the local haberdashery would bring rolls of new printed cottons and pattern-weave wools they didn't want no more, out of charity, I suppose, for us poor little orphan children and the other little orphans we was making the clothes for.</p> <p>You look puzzled. Sorry, I get carried away with me memories. The reason we was so busy sewing at The Castle was because the nuns had been asked by the grand ladies of the London Needlework Society to help them with their good works-which was making clothes for poor people. It made us feel special; we had nothing in the world except our skills, and we were using them to help other children like us.</p> <p>The days when those haberdashers' deliveries arrived was like birthdays and Christmases rolled into one, taking the wrappers off the rolls and discovering new colors and patterns and breathing in that clean, summery smell of new fabric, like clothes drying on a line-there's nothing to match it, even now. When we was growing out of our clothes, the nuns would let us have remnants of patterned cotton to make ourselves new dresses and skirts, and Nora and me would always pick the brightest floral prints. We didn't see too many flowers for real, so it brought a touch of springtime into our lives.</p> <p>"Nora? You knew each other even then?"</p> <p>Oh yes, we go way back. She was my best friend. We was around the same age, so far as we knew, and always shared a dormitory, called ourselves sisters-the family kind, not the nun kind-and swore we'd never be parted. Not that we looked like family by any stretch: she was blond, and by the time we was fourteen, she towered above me at five feet six with big feet she was always tripping over and a laugh like a tidal wave which made anyone around her-even the nuns-break out into a smile. She had large hands too, double the size of mine, but that didn't stop her being a good needleworker. We was naughty little minxes, but we got away with it 'cause we worked hard.</p> <p>Like I say, we was happy because we knew no different, but we was also growing up-even though my chest was flat and my fanny still smooth as a baby's bottom, Nora was getting breasts and hair down there, as well as under her arms, and both of us was starting to give the eye to the gardener's lad and the baker's delivery boy, whenever the nuns weren't watching.</p> <p>That day, we was doing our needlework when this grand lady with a big hat and feathers on the top of her head comes with a gaggle of her lah-di-dah friends, like a royal visit it was, and she leans over what I am embroidering and says, "What fine stitching, my dear. Where did you learn that?"</p> <p>And I says back, "It's daisy chain, ma'am. Would you like to see how it works?" And I finish the daisy with three more chain links spaced evenly around the circle like they are supposed to be and quickly give it a stem and a leaf which doesn't turn out too bad, even though my fingers are trembling and sweaty with being watched by such a grand person. She keeps silence till I've finished and then says in her voice full of plums and a bit foreign, "That is very clever, dear, very pretty. Keep up the good work," and as she moves on to talk to another girl, I breathe in the smell of her, like a garden full of roses, what I have never smelled before on a human being.</p> <p>Afterward I hears her asking Sister Mary about me and Nora, was we good girls and that sort of thing, but we soon forgot about her and that was it for a few months till my birthday-it was January 1911 when I turned fifteen-and me and Nora, whose birthday was just a few days before, gets a summons from Sister Beatrice, the head nun. This only usually happens when one of us has done something wicked like swearing "God" too many times or falling asleep in prayers, so you can imagine the state that Nora and me are in as we go up the stairs to the long corridor with the red Persian runner and go to stand outside the oak door with those carvings that look like folds of fabric in each panel. I am so panicked that I feel like fainting, and I can tell that Nora is trying to stifle the laugh that always bubbles up when she's nervous.</p> <p>Sister calls us in and asks us to sit down on leather-seated chairs that are so high that my legs don't reach the ground and I have to concentrate hard on not swinging them 'cause I know that annoys grown-ups more than anything else in the world.</p> <p>She turns to me first. "Miss Romano? I think it is your birthday today?" she asks, and I am so startled at being called "Miss" that I can't think of anything better to say than, "Yes, ma'am."</p> <p>"Then God bless you, child, and let me wish you many happy returns of this day," she says, nearly smiling.</p> <p>"Thank you, ma'am," I say, trying to ignore the way Nora's body is shaking beside me.</p> <p>"Miss Featherstone?" says Sister, and I know that if Nora opens her mouth, the laugh will just burst out, so she just nods and keeps her head bent down, but this doesn't seem to bother Sister Beatrice, who just says, "I understand that you two are good friends, are you not?" I nod on behalf of us both, and she goes on, "I hear very positive things about the two of you, especially about your needlework skills, and I have some very exciting news."</p> <p>She goes on to tell us that the grand lady who came a few months ago is a duchess and is the patron of the Needlework Society and was visiting to inspect the work that the convent was doing for the poor children of the city. She was so impressed by the needlework Nora and me showed her that she is sending her housekeeper to interview us about going into service.</p> <p>A duchess! Well, you can imagine how excited we was but scared too, as we haven't a clue what to expect, and our imaginations go into overtime. We was going to live in a beautiful mansion with a huge garden and sew clothes for very important people, and Nora is going to fall in love with one of the chauffeurs but I have my sights set a bit higher, a soldier in the Light Brigade in his red uniform perhaps, or a city gent in a bowler hat. Either way, both of us are going to have our own comfortable houses next door to each other with little gardens where we can grow flowers and good things to eat and have lots of children who will play together, and we will live happily ever after.</p> <p>There's a pause. She clears her throat loudly.</p> <p>Forgive me, ...</p></p><h2>Stop Being Lonely: Three Simple Steps to Developing Close Friendships and Deep Relationships</h2><p><b>Loneliness Has an Antidote: The Feeling of Closeness</b><br><br>Loneliness isn&#x2019;t something that happens only when we are physically alone.

No one seems able to stop him. He is so audacious that he lets the police know in advance where he will commit his crimes, each time ridiculing Scotland Yard a little more. The apparent ease with which he evades police schemes begins to worry the highest authorities of the country. The Home Office asks Captain Francis Blake to solve the mystery and discover the identity of the man who hides behind the Yellow Mark. The captain immediately takes as partner his old friend, Professor Philip Mortimer, whose scientific knowledge will be invaluable in solving this extremely complex enigma. Who hides behind the Yellow Mark?</p><p>The characters Blake and Mortimer were the creation of Edgar P. Jacobs, a Belgian artist who assisted Herge on his classic Tintin series. <i>The Yellow "M"</i> (1956) is a moody mystery-adventure that pits Capt. Francis Blake of MI5 and his friend, Prof. Philip Mortimer, against a near-superhuman figure, impervious to gunfire, who is abducting some of Britain's leading citizens and leaving only his yellow mark behind. Jacobs' style shows the influence of Herge, but his storytelling is so dense with text that it slows down the action, making the story not as dynamic as it should be. It's definitely of interest to those who have read all the Tintin books and are looking for something new, but don't expect it to be Tintin. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Born of Edgar Pierre Jacobs&#39; imagination during the post-WWII period, Professor Philip Mortimer, nuclear physicist, and Captain Francis Blake, dashing head of MI5, are legendary heroes of the 9th art. The author, a close relative of Herg�, appreciated the excessive and the astonishing that could be found within the scope of scientific invention; his heroes, very much ahead of their time, discover extraordinary objects and phenomena through their uncommon adventures. Before devoting himself exclusively to them, Edgar Pierre Jacobs collaborated with Herg� and took part in the realization of &#39;Tintin in the Congo&#39;, &#39;Tintin in America&#39;, &#39;The Blue Lotus&#39;, &#39;King Ottokar&#39;s Sceptre&#39;, &#39;The Seven Crystal Balls&#39;, and the &#39;Prisoners of the Sun&#39;.</p><h2>Investors&#39; Guide to Farmland</h2><p>Everyone has to eat to survive. The production of almost all food can be traced back to farmland in some way. Demand is growing for farmland as the world&#x2019;s population and global needs for food are rising. The supply of farmland is not changing, thus creating a severe imbalance in the supply of farmable land and demand for food. The world&#x2019;s population is expected to grow from 7 billion to over 9 billion by 2050. Over the same time period, food production must double. Global grain supplies are already at record low levels. If the US stopped producing corn, it would run out in less than 30 days and set off a domino effect that would bring the world to its knees.

But when he finds a powerful, forbidden weapon from the deep past, a single moment of violence sets his life - and the brutal society of the habitat - into upheaval. Hunted by the cannibalistic Habsec and sheltered by former enemies, Cho finds himself caught within a civil war that threatens to destroy his world.<br><br>A new barbarian sci-fi adventure from SIMON ROY (Prophet, Jan's Atomic Heart, Tiger Lung). Collecting installments originally serialized in ISLAND MAGAZINE issues 2, 5, and 8. <br></p><p>LIBRARY JOURNAL (STARRED) -- Hank Cho is a newly minted security officer aboard a roughly planet-sized, damaged, and abandoned space station marred by constant war among the tribe-like descendants of the original crew. He discovers some ancient and forbidden technology and is thrust into a sprawling escapade that just might decide the fate of society. Will his discovery doom the station to apocalyptic war, or could this be the first step in the station's reunion with the rest of humankind? Featuring bloody battle scenes, political intrigue, and plenty of giant robots, writer and illustrator Roy (Prophet) has crafted a tale that, while short, easily stands beside the best space opera and sf of the last decade while maintaining a sensibility and aesthetic that fans of edgier, more independent comics will love.

Now, for the first time, he tells his story in his own words, via more than fifty interviews conducted worldwide between 1966 and 2012.<br>&nbsp;<br>In<i> Leonard Cohen on Leonard Cohen</i>&#x2014;which includes a foreword by singer Suzanne Vega and eight pages of rarely seen photos&#x2014;the artist talks about &#x201c;Bird on the Wire,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hallelujah,&#x201d; &#x201c;Famous Blue Raincoat,&#x201d; and his other classic songs. He candidly discusses his famous romances, his years in a Zen monastery, his ill-fated collaboration with producer Phil Spector, and his long battle with depression. He also comments on his classic poetry and novels, the financial crisis that nearly wiped out his savings, and his remarkable late-career resurgence.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here you&#x2019;ll find interviews that first appeared in the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i>, along with conversations that have not previously been printed in English.

That such a mind exists is hard to fathom, yet here's the proof. He's as funny as a great humorist, as wise as a scholar, and speaks in parables and poems almost as perfect as his songs. This is a great and rare window into the dedication it takes to be a true artist in modern times.

Yet, science tells us that living beings are merely sophisticated structures of lifeless molecules. If this view is correct, where do the seemingly purposeful motions of cells and organisms originate? In <i>Life's Ratchet</i>, physicist Peter M. Hoffmann locates the answer to this age-old question at the nanoscale.<br><br>Below the calm, ordered exterior of a living organism lies microscopic chaos, or what Hoffmann calls the molecular storm specialized molecules immersed in a whirlwind of colliding water molecules. Our cells are filled with molecular machines, which, like tiny ratchets, transform random motion into ordered activity, and create the purpose&#x201d; that is the hallmark of life. Tiny electrical motors turn electrical voltage into motion, nanoscale factories custom-build other molecular machines, and mechanical machines twist, untwist, separate and package strands of DNA. The cell is like a city an unfathomable, complex collection of molecular workers working together to create something greater than themselves.<br><br>Life, Hoffman argues, emerges from the random motions of atoms filtered through these sophisticated structures of our evolved machinery. We are agglomerations of interacting nanoscale machines more amazing than anything in science fiction. Rather than relying on some mysterious life force&#x201d; to drive them as people believed for centuries life's ratchets harness instead the second law of thermodynamics and the disorder of the molecular storm.<br><br>Grounded in Hoffmann's own cutting-edge research, <i>Life's Ratchet</i> reveals the incredible findings of modern nanotechnology to tell the story of how the noisy world of atoms gives rise to life itself.<br></p><p><b>Peter M. Hoffmann</b> is a professor of physics and materials science at Wayne State University in Michigan and the founder and director of the university's Biomedical Physics program. He lives in Saint Clair Shores, Michigan.<br><b><i>City Book Review</i></b><br> <i>Life's Ratchet</i> is nothing short of brilliant. With wit and literary prowess, author Peter M.

It does a very good job of capturing the excitement driving current research on this increasingly important topic.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Nature</i></b><br> <i>Life's Ratchet</i> engagingly tells the story of how science has begun to realize the potential for matter to spontaneously construct complex processes, such as those inherent to living systems. The book is a good mix of history and the latest concepts, straightforwardly explained . The book's important message is that there is a revolution brewing. This revolution will not tell us what matter is made of. Instead, as described in <i>Life's Ratchet</i>, it will tell us how matter and energy combine to make me and you.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Physics Today</i></b><br> [A] fascinating glimpse into recent research on molecular machines, research that lies at the intersection of biology, chemistry, and physics.... <i>Life's Ratchet</i> does an excellent job of conveying the tension between mechanical descriptions of molecular machines...and the chemical perspective....

Don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen leans into the mirror to pick a clot of mascara off her lashes. This mascara is too old. She&#x2019;ll buy a new tube today, now that she intends to be a regular working woman, someone who, rather than making a thirty-foot commute from bedroom to study and working in her pajamas, actually dresses up and goes out of her house to be among other human beings. She&#x2019;ll buy some antiaging mascara, surely they&#x2019;ve come up with that by now. What she really needs is an antiaging mirror.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not cute, what you&#x2019;re doing,&#x201d; Tessa says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not funky or cool or fun. You&#x2019;ll hate it.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen turns to face her. &#x201c;How do you know? You&#x2019;re talking about yourself. Just because you didn&#x2019;t like working there doesn&#x2019;t mean I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom. Imagine yourself folding the same sweater one hundred times a day. Imagine saying, &#x2018;Welcome to Anthropologie!&#x2019; to hostile customers who only want to be left alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hardly think they&#x2019;ll be hostile.&#x201d;<br><br>Tessa waves her hand as though flicking away the blackfly of her mother&#x2019;s ignorance. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never worked retail. You have no idea how rude people can be. Or how weird.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen refrains from answering, Expect the worst, and you&#x2019;ll get it! She applies a thin coat of coral-colored lipstick.<br><br>&#x201c;Too yellow for your complexion,&#x201d; Tessa says. She is the beauty editor at an online magazine; she makes pronouncements like this with some regularity.<br><br>&#x201c;You gave it to me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, but it&#x2019;s too yellow for your complexion. Throw it out. I&#x2019;ll get you more red tones.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen looks at the tube. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to throw it out. I&#x2019;ll donate it somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom. Mom. It&#x2019;s used.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, then, I&#x2019;ll give it to Grandma.&#x201d; Helen regards herself in the mirrror. She sees that Tessa is right about the color of the lipstick on her. She wipes it off and puts on a pinkish shade. Then she walks to the front hall closet to get her coat.<br><br>&#x201c;This is going to be a complete waste of your time,&#x201d; Tessa says. One eyebrow is arched, and her head is tilted in the &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to say I told you so&#x201d; position.<br><br>&#x201c;The operative word being &#x2018;your.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my time. I can waste it if I want to. And anyway, it won&#x2019;t be a waste. I need a change of pace.&#x201d;<br><br>Tessa puts on her coat. She does not button it, and Helen does not tell her to. As she is frequently reminded, her daughter is twenty-seven years old. Still, it&#x2019;s November and cold outside, an insinuating dampness in the air. Tessa does wrap her muffler securely around her throat, Helen is happy to see.<br><br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t going to listen to me no matter what I say,&#x201d; Tessa says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to go down there and apply and they&#x2019;ll hire you because they&#x2019;re desperate and then you&#x2019;ll see how disgusting it is to work with spoiled brats and then you&#x2019;ll quit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Helen says. &#x201c;It will be something to do. Won&#x2019;t it. Do you want a ride back downtown?&#x201d;<br><br>Tessa wordlessly exits the house, letting the storm door fall shut instead of holding it open for her mother, who is close behind her. Helen figures the whole way downtown, Tessa will continue to punish her, and she considers for a moment telling her daughter to take the el home, but she won&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s her daughter. She wonders how many times in her life she&#x2019;s told herself that.<br><br>There is silence until they are out of Oak Park and onto the Eisenhower, and then Helen looks over at Tessa, who is pointedly staring straight ahead.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s spoiled?&#x201d; she asks, and is gratified to see Tessa smile, then reach over and turn on the CD player. It&#x2019;s over.<br><br>Tessa selects Nicole Atkins&#x2019;s Neptune City and turns the volume up. Helen boosts the volume a bit more. On music she and her daughter agree completely. They have even gone to concerts together, and Tessa never seems to be embarrassed by the fact that she is there with her mother. Oftentimes, they will both hear something in a song, and turn to smile at each other like girlfriends. They feel music in the same way; it is a source of pride for Helen. Helen&#x2019;s best friend, Midge, has a daughter Tessa&#x2019;s age, and Amanda plays music that Midge says makes her feel like shooting herself, twice. But Tessa custom-mixes a CD for her mother every Christmas, selecting her own favorite songs of the moment, and it is always Helen&#x2019;s favorite gift.<br><br>Helen&#x2019;s husband, Dan, died suddenly eleven months and three days ago, dropping his coffee cup and sliding almost noiselessly out of his kitchen chair and onto the floor. Helen, who&#x2019;d been standing at the sink, still feels guilty about yelling at him for breaking his cup before she turned to see him sprawled on his back, his eyes wide open and startled-looking. She believes the last thing Dan felt was surprise, and to her way of thinking, it wasn&#x2019;t a bad way to go. The bad part is he left her here without him, ignorant of . . . oh, everything.<br><br>People used to accuse her of being overly dependent on Dan, and it was true. &#x201c;You give away your power,&#x201d; one friend told Helen. &#x201c;You infantilize yourself.&#x201d; On that occasion, Helen looked down at her salad plate as though acknowledging culpability and feeling bad about it, but what she was thinking was, Oh, shut up. It feels good to infantilize myself. You ought to try it. Might take an edge off.<br><br>On that awful day when Helen realized her husband was dead, it nonetheless occurred to her to ask him what to do about the fact that he had just died. She had called the paramedics; she had tried CPR, now what should she do? When it came to her&#x2014;slowly at first, then in a breath-snatching rush of feeling&#x2014;that she could not ask him this or any other thing ever again, Helen ran to the bathroom to vomit. Then she ran back to kneel beside Dan, and called his name over and over again. And then she called Tessa, to ask her what to do.<br><br>As soon as Tessa heard her mother say her name, her voice dropped to a flat and foreboding pitch to ask, &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; But she knew, she later told Helen, she knew right away that her dad had died. After Helen hung up the phone, she swept up the shards of broken china, including one that had cut Dan&#x2019;s hand. Then she put a Band-Aid over the wound on his little finger because although he was now clearly beyond needing her care, she was not beyond needing to care for him. She sat staring at the cuff of his sleeve, trying not to think, until the paramedics finally arrived and pronounced Dan dead. Helen thought, Those words don&#x2019;t even go together, &#x201c;your husband&#x201d; and &#x201c;dead.&#x201d; And then she experienced the oddest sensation. It was of feeling herself ascend&#x2014;her, not Dan. She felt as though she were leaving the planet and her own life, never to return. Because she was herself, but she was also Dan: they had merged their two personalities to create a shared one, that was what their marriage was, and she lived inside the marriage more than she lived inside herself. For her to lose Dan&#x2014;especially so suddenly&#x2014;was to step off a cliff where the falling seemed never to stop.<br><br>In addition to her greatest love, Helen has lost the person who handled the practical side of their life together. All this time later, Helen is still shaky on managing the simplest aspects of her finances, despite the fact that she has an accountant to ask questions of. She trusted Dan to take care of his own income and hers; she didn&#x2019;t want to know anything about what he was doing. Numbers had made her nervous since early on in elementary school, when her teacher had announced ominously that tomorrow they were going to start learning fractions, and the whole class had groaned. Helen remembers sitting in her plaid dress with the little bow at the neckline, laying her pencil down carefully in the desk trough and thinking, Okay, that&#x2019;s it for me. She&#x2019;d been having trouble enough with what they were doing; long division made her jiggle her leg and yank at her bangs; she was not interested in being challenged further. Later she would learn about math anxiety and the things one might do to help oneself, but by that time it was irrelevant. She and Dan both were used to her making astonishing mistakes in the world of numbers: &#x201c;It was four hundred and fifty dollars,&#x201d; she once told Dan about a refrigerator she had looked at and wanted to buy after theirs had broken. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Dan asked. &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I remember exactly! Four hundred and fifty dollars.&#x201d; It was, in fact, four thousand, five hundred. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Helen said, when Dan came with her to the appliance store and showed her the price tag.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t see her shortcomings as serious problems. What she believed was that each person brought to a marriage certain strengths and weaknesses; so each became naturally responsible for certain things. She rolled out the piecrusts and scheduled doctors appointments; Dan balanced the checkbook and managed their holdings at Morgan Stanley.<br><br>After her husband&#x2019;s death, Helen had left the investment firm&#x2019;s monthly statements sitting unopened on Dan&#x2019;s desk until a few days ago, when she mailed them to the accountant. She&#x2019;ll get around to looking at them when she&#x2019;s ready, if she needs to. She knows that whatever is there has been both wisely and conservatively invested and is earning a fair amount of interest; that much of what Dan told her she retained.<br><br>Mechanical repairs have become a more immediate problem. This morning, in fact, Tessa had taken the forty-five-minute el ride out to her mother&#x2019;s house to reset Helen&#x2019;s garbage disposal, adjust the flapper on her toilet, and replace a lightbulb in the ceiling of the front porch while Helen steadied the ladder, she was really very good at steadying ladders. Helen knows she should hire a handyman since she is unable or unwilling to learn about such things, but thus far, Tessa has not complained about helping her mother&#x2014;in some ways, Helen feels it is her daughter&#x2019;s legacy.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have to do everything?&#x201d; Dan used to say, kind of kidding and kind of not, and Helen would say, &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; and she was not kidding at all. She figured cooking and cleaning and the better part of child rearing were enough of a contribution, that and the money she made from writing, which was not insignificant. She contributed her imagination to the relationship, didn&#x2019;t that count for something? It may have been Dan who built the playhouse for their daughter, but it was Helen who had conceived of the idea for the design, complete with take-out window just off the kitchen, this because Tessa&#x2019;s ambitions at the time included having a drive-up pie shop.<br><br>Still, Helen had meant to help out a bit more at some point. She&#x2019;d had glittering intentions to roll up her sleeves one day and become a citizen of the hands-on world, to acquaint herself with Dan&#x2019;s toolbox, with the way to change batteries and filters and fuses. She meant to learn to jump-start a car and change a tire. (&#x201c;Well, why do we have Triple A?&#x201d; Helen asked when Dan offered one day to show her these things. And Dan said, &#x201c;What if Triple A doesn&#x2019;t come?&#x201d; &#x201c;When would that happen?&#x201d; Helen asked. &#x201c;Believe me, it happens,&#x201d; Dan said, and Helen said oh all right, she would learn but not today, she was wearing white pants today. On her way back into the house, she deadheaded some petunias in the garden, thinking, See? I help!)<br><br>The day for Helen&#x2019;s baptism into practicality had never come, in the way that most people never get around to cleaning the attic or garage, leaving their survivors to argue with their siblings over what stays and what goes. And so now she has made her daughter her fix-it man. She knows it&#x2019;s wrong, but she tells herself it is temporary. She&#x2019;ll be glad when she and Tessa go to visit her parents for Christmas. Then Tessa will get a break from being on call, for Helen&#x2019;s father is the consummate fix-it man: one of the first things he always does is ask if anyone has brought anything for him to repair. He&#x2019;s a specialist in stain removal, harbors some now illegal substance in his basement that works like a charm.<br><br>Last July, when Helen and Tessa came to visit, they took a walk around the neighborhood and Tessa asked her, &#x201c;Mom? How come Grandma and Grandpa live in such a tiny house? Everything&#x2019;s so tiny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t so tiny when they bought it,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;People didn&#x2019;t used to have such big houses. Look around: all the houses in this neighborhood are tiny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>Carefully, then, Helen said, &#x201c;I kind of like it. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about downsizing, myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just . . . You know, I think it might be nice to have a smaller place. Not so much to take care of. When Dad and I first got married, we lived in a really small one-bedroom apartment, and I loved how cozy it was. We lived above the landlady. Her name was Mrs. Assolino, and she had this really low and distinctive voice. She used to call us all the time, complaining about this thing or that: we were too noisy, or our blinds weren&#x2019;t pulled down evenly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Tessa said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yeah. When we moved in, she said&#x201d;&#x2014;and here Helen spoke in a low, gravelly voice&#x2014;&#x201c;?&#x2018;This is my house, see? And I don&#x2019;t like the blinds to be uneven. It looks sloppy from the outside. So keep the blinds even.&#x2019; We would try to remember, but we never did and then she would call us to complain and she could never get our name right. She would say, &#x2018;Hello, Mrs. James? I&#x2019;m calling about the blinds. This is Mrs. Assolino.&#x2019; As though it would be anyone else!&#x201d;<br><br>Tessa was silent. Then she said, &#x201c;You love our house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m not doing anything yet. Just thinking about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was that apartment you guys lived in in San Francisco?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you stay there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t like it,&#x201d; Helen said, remembering the way she would sit at the window staring out at the piece of the ocean she could see, homesick for the Midwest, for the flatness of the land, the plainness of it. It was taxing to live in a place like San Francisco, where tourists crowded the sidewalks and exclaimed over the beauty, and the people who lived there were so happy; did everyone have to be so happy all the time?<br><br>&#x201c;How could you not like it?&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;I would love to live in San Francisco!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, you wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You always do this. You can&#x2019;t decide for me what&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen supposes downsizing might be inevitable, but she can&#x2019;t give it much thought now. There is, after all, a more pressing concern: she can no longer write. Bad enough that writing was the way she made her living; it was also her anchor, her lens, her abiding consolation. Next to Dan, it was her greatest love. Without her husband or the practice of laying out words on a page, she feels that she spends her days rattling around inside herself; that, whereas she used to be a whole and happy woman, now she is many pieces of battered self, slung together in a sack of skin.<br><br>In what she now thinks of as the olden days, she would leap out of bed, her mind watered, as she used to say, by the rich blankness of sleep. She would pour herself a cup of coffee, go and sit in her study in her pajamas and write for four to five hours, then get dressed and carry on with the rest of the day. That meant first scanning the newspaper, trying to focus on the stories about the better side of humanity, and reading the want ads for dogs, she liked particularly to see if there were any English mastiffs being offered. Dan was allergic to pet dander and they&#x2019;d never had so much as a parakeet, but Helen grew up with dogs and missed them, their glad eyes, the way their paws smelled like corn chips.<br><br>After the paper, there was grocery shopping and laundry; expeditions about town to run errands; and always, always, always, people watching. Helen thought o...</p><h2>Return Engagement (Settling Accounts, Book 1)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;[Harry Turtledove] handles his huge cast with admirable skill. The insights into racial politics elevate this novel to a status above mere entertainment, although it provides that aplenty.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i></b><br><br>It&#x2019;s 1941, and an alliance of peace holds in check the most powerful nations of the world&#x2014;but it is an uneasy peace.

Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. Opposite him is Al Smith, a Socialist U.S. president in the Philadelphia White House. Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the hell of war and depression. <br><br>Featherston and his Freedom Party are determined to conquer their Northern neighbor at any cost. After crushing a Negro rebellion in his own nation, Featherston sends Confederate army planes to attack Philadelphia.

Drawing on a magnificent cast of characters that includes soldiers, generals, lovers, spies, and demagogues, Turtledove returns to an epic tale that only he could tell-the story of a North American continent, separated into two bitterly opposed nations, that stands on the verge of exploding once again. <br>In 1914 they called it The Great War, and few could imagine anything worse. For nearly three decades a peace forged in blood and fatigue has held sway in North America. Now, Japan dominates the Pacific, the Russian Tsar rules Alaska, and England, under Winston Churchill, chafes for a return to its former glory. But behind the faade of world order, America is a bomb waiting to go off. Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. <br>In the White House in Philadelphia, Socialist President Al Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the fires of war and the flood tides of depression. In the South, Featherston and his ruling Freedom Party have put down a Negro rebellion with a bloody fist and have interned them in concentration camps. Now they are determined to crush their Northern neighbor at any cost. <br>Featherston's planes attack Philadelphia without warning. The U.S.A. lashes back blindly at Charleston. And a terrible second coming is at hand. When the CSA blitzkrieg is launched, the U.S.A. is caught flat-footed. Before long, the gray Army reaches Lake Erie. But in its wake the war machine is spinning a vortex of destruction, betrayal, and fury that no one, not even Jake Featherston himself, can control. <br>Now, President Smith faces a Herculean task, while an obscure assistant secretary of war named Roosevelt rises in his ranks. For the U.S.A., the darkest days still lay ahead. Across the globe, a new era of war has just begun. And in the hands of the incomparable Harry Turtledove, readers are treated to a masterful vision of what might have been.

Tiffany M. Gill argues that the beauty industry played a crucial role in the creation of the modern black female identity and that the seemingly frivolous space of a beauty salon actually has stimulated social, political, and economic change. </p><p>From the founding of the National Negro Business League in 1900 and onward, African Americans have embraced the entrepreneurial spirit by starting their own businesses, but black women's forays into the business world were overshadowed by those of black men. With a broad scope that encompasses the role of gossip in salons, ethnic beauty products, and the social meanings of African American hair textures, Gill shows how African American beauty entrepreneurs built and sustained a vibrant culture of activism in beauty salons and schools. Enhanced by lucid portrayals of black beauticians and drawing on archival research and oral histories, <i>Beauty Shop Politics</i> conveys the everyday operations and rich culture of black beauty salons as well as their role in building community.</p></p><p><p><b>Tiffany M.

Michael Kenna is internationally renowned for producing evocative black-and-white images of nature and the urban environment. Often photographing at night or in the early morning hours, the majority of his photographs involve long time exposures with the camera on a tripod. However, some of Kenna&#x2019;s more quirky, whimsical, and unpredictable images have been photographed with inexpensive, hand-held, plastic Holga cameras. These cameras generally produce relatively lowfidelity images, with marked vignetting. Precisely because of these attributes and its portability, Kenna often carries a Holga camera, even when he is not specifically photographing. For this beautifully produced book, Kenna has chosen his favorite Holga images, many never seen before, from his vast archive of negatives. Despite their low-tech origin, these refined and artful photographs bear the hallmarks of Kenna's brilliant work.</p><p>Michael Kenna is a U.S.-based, British photographer, best known for his black-and-white, landscape, and urban landscape photography. He is the author of Rouge and Forms of Japan (both by Prestel).</p><h2>Callimachus: The Hymns</h2><p>Callimachus was arguably the most important poet of the Hellenistic age, for two reasons: his engagement with previous theorists of poetry and his wide-ranging poetic experimentation. Of his poetic oeuvre, which exceeded what we now have of Theocritus, Aratus, Posidippus, and Apollonius combined, only his six hymns and around fifty of his epigrams have survived intact. His enormously influential Aetia, the collection of Iambi, the Hecale, and all of his prose output have been reduced to a handful of citations in later Greek lexica and handbooks or papyrus fragments. In recent years excellent commentaries and synthetic studies of the Aetia, the Iambi, and the Hecale have appeared or are about to appear. But there is no modern study in English of the collection of hymns. And while there are excellent commentaries in English on three of the hymns (Apollo, Athena, Demeter), the commentaries on Zeus and on Delos are limited in scope, and there is no commentary at all on the Artemis hymn. Synthetic studies in English for the most part treat only one hymn, not the collection, and tend to focus on Callimachus' intertextual relationships with his predecessors and/or his influence on Roman poetry. Yet recent work is requiring scholars to broaden their perspective and to consider Callimachus' religious, civic, and geo-political contexts much more systematically in attempting to understand the hymns. A further incentive is that apart from the Homeric and Orphic hymns, Callimachus' are the only other hymns that have survived intact; those written in earlier periods are now reduced to fragments. For these reasons a study of the six hymns together is a desideratum. An additional reason is that Callimachus' collection of six hymns is very likely to have been an authorially arranged poetry book, quite possibly the earliest such book that we have intact; therefore, it allows a unique perspective on the evolution of the form. <br><br>This volume offers a text and commentary of all six hymns for advanced students of classics and classical scholars, as well as interpretive essays on each hymn that integrate what has been the dominant paradigm-intertextuality-into a broader focus on Callimachus' context. Her introduction treats the transmission of the hymns, the potential for and likelihood of the Homeric hymns as models, the hymns as a poetry book, their language and meter (especially in light of recent work done on this topic), performance practices, and their relationship to cult, court, local geographies, and panhellenic sanctuaries. For each hymn Stephens presents the Greek text, a translation, and a brief commentary containing important information or parallels for interpretation.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susan A. Stephens</strong> is Sara Hart Kimball Professor in the Humanities and Professor of Classics at Stanford University.<br><br>"This new Callimachean commentary has a modest goal: "to provide readers with a convenient and accessible edition of all six of Callimachus' hymns in one volume, accompanied by notes sufficient for ease of reading" (p. vii). S(tephens) has in fact produced a very helpful edition which more than fulfils this ambition and will be of much use to readers of Callimachus' hymns, especially those tackling his work for the first time. Alongside considerable linguistic help, S. offers concise yet lively interpretations of these poems, succinctly distilling the fruits of past scholarship while also adding new interpretations of her own." --Thomas J. Nelson, <em>Mnemosyne</em><p></p><br>"...Stephens shines in illuminating Callimachus's imagery and engagement with the Ptolemaic court. She preserves balance, not overwhelming newcomers with detail yet offering new insights for scholars. ... [T]his volume provides a needed and accessible edition of the collection. Stephens's scholarship and sensitivity to Callimachus's poetry suffuse every page. Invaluable for those interested in Hellenistic poetry; important for students of mythology, history of religion, and Greek literature. ... Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"...Stephens...integrates the best of modern scholarship with her own insights to provide a rich and up-to-date guide to the hymns. ... Stephens has produced a deeply learned and highly useful work that should be warmly welcomed by scholars and students alike." --<em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"I would recommend this book to classicists who are interested in the Hymns and want to know more about them. Graduate students studying for their exams are another natural audience.

This carefully researched book provides the first synthetic and contextualized study of German Orientalistik, a subject of special interest because German scholars were the pace-setters in oriental studies between about 1830 and 1930, despite entering the colonial race late and exiting it early. The book suggests that we must take seriously German orientalism&#39;s origins in Renaissance philology and early modern biblical exegesis and appreciate its modern development in the context of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century debates about religion and the Bible, classical schooling, and Germanic origins. In ranging across the subdisciplines of Orientalistik, German Orientalism in the Age of Empire introduces readers to a host of iconoclastic characters and forgotten debates, seeking to demonstrate both the richness of this intriguing field and its indebtedness to the cultural world in which it evolved.</p><p>This carefully researched book provides the first synthetic and contextualized study of German Orientalistik.

Based on an advanced class taught by a world-renowned mathematician for more than fifty years, the treatment introduces semi-Riemannian geometry and its principal physical application, Einstein's theory of general relativity, using the Cartan exterior calculus as a principal tool. <br>Starting with an introduction to the various curvatures associated to a hypersurface embedded in Euclidean space, the text advances to a brief review of the differential and integral calculus on manifolds. A discussion of the fundamental notions of linear connections and their curvatures follows, along with considerations of Levi-Civita's theorem, bi-invariant metrics on a Lie group, Cartan calculations, Gauss's lemma, and variational formulas. Additional topics include the Hopf-Rinow, Myer's, and Frobenius theorems; special and general relativity; connections on principal and associated bundles; the star operator; superconnections; semi-Riemannian submersions; and Petrov types. Prerequisites include linear algebra and advanced calculus, preferably in the language of differential forms.</p><p></p><h2>Anti-Imperial Metropolis: Interwar Paris and the Seeds of Third World Nationalism (Global and International History)</h2><p>This book traces the spread of a global anti-imperialism from the vantage point of Paris between the two World Wars, where countless future leaders of Third World countries spent formative stints. Exploring the local social context in which these emergent activists moved, the study delves into assassination plots allegedly hatched by Chinese students, demonstrations by Latin American nationalists, and the everyday lives of Algerian, Senegalese, and Vietnamese workers. On the basis of police reports and other primary sources, the book foregrounds the role of migration and interaction as driving forces enabling challenges to the imperial world order, weaving together the stories of peoples of three continents. Drawing on the scholarship of twentieth-century imperial, international, and global history as well as migration, race, and ethnicity in France, it ultimately proposes a new understanding of the roots of the Third World idea.</p><p>The book examines the social life of non-Europeans in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s and describes the political outgrowths of their migration to France. It argues that this migration was crucial for decolonization and the rise of a Third World consciousness after World War II.Michael Goebel is a historian of modern Latin America in its global connections.

Covering a wide gamut of texts and genres, this far-reaching and user-friendly volume is easily paired with most anthologies of plays and is accessible even to those without a literary background. </p><p><br>Contending that there are no right or wrong answers in play analysis, Rush emphasizes the importance of students developing insights of their own. The process is twofold: understand the critical terms that are used to define various parts and then apply these to a particular play. Rush clarifies the concepts of plot, character, and language, advancing Aristotle&#x2019;s concept of the Four Causes as a method for approaching a play through various critical windows. He describes the essential difference between a story and a play, outlines four ways of looking at plays, and then takes up the typical structural devices of a well-made play, four primary genres and their hybrids, and numerous styles, from expressionism to postmodernism. </p><p><br>For each subject, he defines critical norms and analyzes plays common to the canon. <i>A Student Guide to Play Analysis</i> draws on thoughtful examinations of such dramas as <i>The Cherry Orchard, The Good Woman of Setzuan, Fences, The Little Foxes, A Doll House, The Glass Menagerie, </i>and<i> The Emperor Jones</i>. Each chapter ends with a list of questions that will guide students in further study.</p></p><p><p><b>David Rush</b> is an associate professor of theatre at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, where he has taught play analysis for over ten years. Named 2002 Playwriting Teacher of the Year by the Association for Theatre in Higher Education, Rush is a Resident Writer Emeritus of the Chicago Dramatists and an ensemble member at the Stage Left Theater in Chicago. He has written over twenty plays and musicals, including the productions<i>Cuttings </i>(2003), <i>Prairie Lights</i> (2002), and<i> Police Deaf Near Far</i> (2000),<i>Dapples &amp; Grays </i>(1994), and <i>Leander Stillwell</i> (1992).</p>"This is the most comprehensive text on script analysis, perfect for the entry-level undergraduate course in the field.

The 1960s' classic book Bear Markets has been fully updated and revised to reflect the unprecedented changes taking place in today's volatile economic environment-making it extremely relevant to the current financial market. This book provides the necessary tools for investors to construct a portfolio that will allow them to protect and grow their money under the most severe bear market conditions through technical analysis and models of numerous bear market variables. Bear Market Investing Strategies offers practical and approachable strategies that every investor needs today.</p><p>"The first investment book I ever read - in the late 1960s - was Harry Schultz's Bear Markets. After watching the late 1990s lunacy and inevitable fallout, I feel every market student and investor should read a great book on bear markets and thus become wise through the printed word not later through painful disillusion. To the rescue at the right time again comes Harry's new take on the subject, Bear Market Investing Strategies. Full of wisdom and practical advice, this book is an utter necessity for anyone who wants to learn how to make money in all market trends, not just rising ones." --Robert R. Prechter, Jr., President, Elliott Wave International<br> <br> "Harry Schultz probably has more bear market experience than anyone...and plenty of experience in pseudo-bull markets too. Now, he's come up with a book that can be very important for investors at this awkward stage of the world economy and market. Buy the book...it could save you a lot of money." --Bill Bonner, Daily Reckoning Newsletter and market analyst<br> <br> "Harry is a worldwide respected guru and market analyst. A major character in my novel, The Moneychangers, was based on Harry. His new street-smart book is the right medicine for this market. From this long-time admirer, I hope his latest investment wisdom will find the large audience it deserves." --Arthur Hailey<br> <br> "Harry has come up with what people NEED most at this awkward stage of the world economy and markets. This book covers a variety of advices to help you make the right decisions. Who could ask for more?" --Jim Sinclair, Ex-NY market marker, Chairman, Tan Range Resources<br> <br> "Harry Schultz's 1964 Bear Market book was a guiding light that helped me (at Rothschild Bank) to travel successfully through the long bear markets of the 1970s. This new book is coming out again at exactly the right time to protect investors in the extremely dangerous bear markets at hand, which look to become worse than the '70s. Harry Schultz as accumulated another 40 years of invaluable experience since his first bear markets book. Having followed Harry Schultz for 38 years, I can only say this new book is worth a fortune." --Ferdinand Lips, author, ex-Chairman Bank Lips, Zurich, Switzerland<br> <br> "Harry Schultz is one of the most experienced and canny traders ever. The keys to his success: he really knows how to read price charts, and his healthy skepticism lets him see through market spin and fad theories, which abound, especially in late-stage super-cycle bull markets. As the latest of these generational upswings for stocks ended in 1999/2000, Harry's new book could not be more timely for investors who wish to profit in a changed environment." --David Fuller, Global Strategist, Stockcube Research Ltd. &amp; writer of Fullermoney (www.fullermoney.com)<br> <br> "Harry's understanding of global financial and political developments is second to none. His analysis of investment markets is brilliant and his common-sense insights on subjects from A to Z are unbeatable." --Don McAlvany, The McAlvany Intelligence AdvisorHarry Schultz has been identifying bear market warning signals and teaching people how to prepare a profitable survival portfolio for over thirty-seven years through his consultancy, books and highly acclaimed newsletter, The International Harry Schultz Newsletter.<br> <br> Investors have been reaping the rewards of excellent stock market returns for the last 20 years, however all that has and is changing in today's more volatile economic and financial environment. This book provides the necessary tools to help investors construct portfolios that will allow them to protect and grow their money under the most severe market conditions.</p><h2>Excursions in Number Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>"A splendidly written, well selected and presented collection ... I recommend the book unreservedly to all readers, in or out of professional mathematics, who like to 'follow the gleam' of numbers." &#x2014; Martin Gardner.<br>The theory of numbers is an ancient and fascinating branch of mathematics that plays an important role in modern computer theory. It is also a popular topic among amateur mathematicians (who have made many contributions to the field) because of its accessibility: it does not require advanced knowledge of higher mathematics.<br>This delightful volume, by two well-known mathematicians, invited readers to join a challenging expedition into the mystery and magic of number theory. No special training is needed &#x2014; just high school mathematics, a fondness for figures, and an inquisitive mind. Such a person will soon be absorbed and intrigued by the ideas and problems presented here.<br>Beginning with familiar notions, the authors skillfully yet painlessly transport the reader to higher realms of mathematics, developing the necessary concepts along the way, so that complex subjects can be more easily understood. Included are thorough discussions of prime numbers, number patterns, irrationals and iterations, and calculating prodigies, among other topics.<br>Much of the material presented is not to be found in other popular treatments of number theory. Moreover, there are many important proofs (presented with simple and elegant explanations) often lacking in similar volumes. In sum, <i>Excursions in Number Theory</i> offers a splendid compromise between highly technical treatments inaccessible to lay readers and popular books with too little substance. Its stimulating and challenging presentation of significant aspects of number theory may be read lightly for enjoyment or studied closely for an exhilarating mental challenge.</p><p></p><h2>Reliability Engineering and Risk Analysis: A Practical Guide, Third Edition</h2><p><p>This undergraduate and graduate textbook provides a practical and comprehensive overview of reliability and risk analysis techniques.

From these experiences a theme of loss resonates&#x2014;loss of land, of freedom, of language, of culture, of self, and of ideals born from independence. Nathalie Etoke demonstrates that, beyond territorial expropriation and the pain inflicted upon the body and the soul, the violence that seals the encounter with the &#x2018;other&#x2019; annihilates an age-old cycle of life. In the wake of this annihilation, continental and diasporic Africans strive to reconcile that which has been destroyed with what has been newly introduced. Their survival depends on their capacity to negotiate the inherent tension of their historical becoming. The book develops a transdisciplinary method encompassing historicism, critical theory, Africana existential thought, and poetics.</p><p><p>Nathalie Etoke is Associate Professor of Francophone and Africana Studies at the Graduate Center, CUNY. <br><br></p><p>Bill Hamlett is a translator, researcher, and teacher of French. He holds master&#x2019;s degrees in French from Middlebury College and in Literary Theory from the �cole Normale Sup�rieure.</p>Melancholia Africana is a journey inward and outward, between memory and forgetting, facing the psychic horrors to the Africana soul by the chaos of globalization by default. Nathalie Etoke dialectically connects Goree Island and Chicago, Elmina and Birmingham, Duala and Fort-de-France. Diasporic solidarity requires creativity for/giving and re-membering. Etoke invokes a diverse chorus including Fanon, Du Bois, Nina Simone and John Coltrane. (Sam O.

Anthony s most recent book, I Speak, is co-authored with famed US photographer (and student of Ansel Adams), Megan Wyeth. That publication includes dozens of Megan s art prints of rare guitars from Anthony s collection and surrealistic interviews with the guitars (written by Anthony). The world premiere opening of the gallery exhibition, I Speak, was in Chartres, France and is slated for showing in select cities in the US and Europe through 2017 (visit: I Speak on Facebook). Anthony s nine CDs and DVDs include, Overview, hailed as one of the Top-5 Classical Releases by Vienna Life Magazine alongside Leonard Bernstein and Murray Perahia.

According to the Bible, this event could even occur today! Are you ready for it? For many centuries Christians have been confused about the timing, participants, seriousness, purpose, and final outcome of this great divine evaluation of the Church. Is it the next revealed event on God&#39;s calendar? Will all Christians be involved or only leaders? Is this event distinct from God&#39;s judgment of unbelievers? Is this a judgment to determine a person&#39;s eternal salvation or eternal reward? Will this event be essentially positive or will it involve punishment for disobedience? What effects will this judgment have afterwards in Christ&#39;s kingdom? THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST was originally written as Dr. Samuel L. Hoyt&#39;s doctoral dissertation and has now been revised and updated to answer these relevant questions from Scripture with careful, balanced, and thorough exegesis.

Quilters have been asking for more, and Jane delivers with a collection of 8 vivid new quilts that give the French Braid some bold and surprising twists. You'll want to try them all&#x2015;from scrappy French Braids, to braids with variable widths and lengths, and much more. Easy strip piecing and clear instructions guarantee success for quilters of all levels. Collect all four of the best-selling French Braid quilt books.</p><p>In the decade since Jane Hardy Miller (www.frenchbraidquilts.com) first started designing French Braid quilts, she has written three best-selling books and introduced thousands of quilters to the dramatic (and astonishingly easy!) French Braid technique. She lives and teaches quilting in Miami, Florida.Many people have a specific vision of what a French braid quilt looks like, but Miller took the basic idea and came up with eight wonderfully original patterns, each different from the next. Her obvious enthusiasm for the traditional pattern translates into clear and helpful instructions for each technique. Each quilt is made in two luscious colorways to inspire creativity and provide options. (<i>Quilter's Newsletter, December 14/January 15</i>)<br><br>Miller (French Braid Obsession) has dedicated 11 years to the technique of piecing quilts that mirror hanks of hair tightly plaited in French braids. This fourth book in her "evolving style" coaches quilters in the sometimes tedious intricacies of marking, cutting, and piecing strips of fabric to stunning effect. She addresses two questions that have arisen about her process: the first is about fabrics that resemble chevrons in the braids and the second concerns the sizes of segments. Although previously, Miller has supported closely shaded fabrics in the "run" of the braid, she has now broadened her thinking, based on quilts made by others: "less-than-perfect braid runs still looked good." As for size, Miller varies segments in each quilt project and also within some of them. While laying out detailed instructions for the experienced quilter, Miller offers a semi-invisible way to machine-bind. The eight projects include scrap-quilt versions, such as "Crazy Braid," and ones with floating stars. Her encouraging style is firmly pedantic, and her tips are based on experience.

They have one foot here in the everyday world and one foot in the world of the spirits. The fact is, we all live in these two different worlds, but are commonly not aware of the other, less visible one. This world does not exist in some other place, but is right beside us, just outside of our usual perceptions. Seeing in the Dark is a definitive source for personal shamanism and not only provides the tools and techniques of the shaman, but presents the wisdom tradition, awareness paradigm, and shamanic way of life. The powerful shamanic path has weathered the cataclysmic changes of over 50,000 years of human history and is even more vital and relevant today. In times when stress, tension, and the fast pace of life overwhelm us, this path shows us how to slow down, reconnect to the sacred, and harness our personal power--skills that will be needed for the uncertain days ahead. Included in this book are over 100 easy-to-follow exercises that teach important survival skills for the coming changes of 2012 and beyond.</p><p>Seeing in the Dark is a definitive source for personal shamanism and not only provides the tools and techniques of the shaman, but presents the wisdom tradition, awareness paradigm, and shamanic way of life.

It provides English-speaking readers with access to a critical work in the development of the most significant figure in twentieth-century German poetry. A tripartite work comprising "The Book of the Monkish Life," "The Book of Pilgrimage," and "The Book of Poverty and Death," The Book of Hours is published here in a bilingual format, with the original German and the English translation on facing pages. Conveying an almost mystical conception of the relationship among God, man, and nature, The Book of Hours (Das Stunden-Buch, first published in 1905) is a series of intimate prayers written as if by a Russian monk turned painter-writings that bring to bear the profound influence of Rilke's journeys to Russia and Italy at the turn of the century. Annemarie S. Kidder's delicately nuanced translation preserves Rilke's uncomplicated and melodic flow, his rhythm, and, where possible, his rhyme while remaining true to content. Kidder's introduction and notes offer historical and interpretive background information, largely from Rilke's own diaries and correspondence, chronicling the influence of various geographical settings on the writing of The Book of Hours and illustrating Rilke's own spiritual quest. Also included are translated excerpts of an earlier manuscript of The Book of Hours, along with interpretations of the poetry.<br>Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) is the author of<i> Duino Elegies</i>,<i> The Sonnets to Orpheus</i>, and the novel <i>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge</i>.

The narrator introduces each superpower, or trait, by describing it as a special ability, then explaining how it works. Text boxes and quizzes are interspersed throughout and add a bit of fun. The illustrations, which have a vintage look to them, alternate between comic depictions of rodents and more detailed diagrams that identify different physical features of beavers and their habitats. The text is clear and friendly, though it occasionally tries too hard to be cute.

The island&#x2019;s recorded history of more than two and a half millennia encompasses waves of immigration from the South Asian subcontinent, the formation of Sinhala Buddhist and Tamil Hindu civilizations, the arrival of Arab Muslim traders, and European colonization by the Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British. Selected texts depict perceptions of the country&#x2019;s multiple linguistic and religious communities, as well as its political travails after independence in 1948, especially the ethnic violence that recurred from the 1950s until 2009, when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were defeated by the Sri Lankan government&#x2019;s armed forces. This wide-ranging anthology covers the aboriginal Veddhas, the earliest known inhabitants of the island; the Kings of Kandy, Sri Lanka&#x2019;s last indigenous dynasty; twenty-first-century women who leave the island to work as housemaids in the Middle East; the forty thousand Sri Lankans killed by the tsunami in December 2004; and, through cutting-edge journalism and heart-wrenching poetry, the protracted violence that has scarred the country&#x2019;s contemporary political history.

(<i>CHOICE, March 2010</i>)<br><br>I selected <i>Gods in the Desert</i> as one of the texts for my course in Middle Eastern Civilizations. There is no other book like it out there, and it is successful in distilling so much material into such a brief and accessible book. The writing is clear, avoids jargon, and really informs. It fills a real void in undergraduate texts. (Curtis F. Morgan Jr., Lord Fairfax Community College)<br><br>A valuable introduction for students and general readers alike. Glenn Holland's accessible prose and carefully structured approach take the reader on an engaging journey through time across Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Syria-Palestine. His exploration of key themes, thoughtful treatment of celebrated primary sources, and judicious handling of history combine effectively to map out the religious and cultural landscape of these fascinating regions. (Dexter E. Callender Jr., University of Miami)<br><br>An excellent book. I like the scope. I like its readability. I like that he approaches topics related to biblical history without pressing 'red buttons' for my students, who tend to be theologically conservative. I'll definitely adopt this text. (Robert Mullins, Azusa Pacific University)<br><br>Survey books tend to oversimplify, but this book provides a nuanced presentation of ancient religious practice. If used for undergraduate teaching, this book would be useful as a resource, providing general descriptions of ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions.

Two months early, underweight and under-prepared for life, he entered the world with cerebral palsy and an uncertain future. So how did this hairless mole-rat of a boy blossom into a viral internet sensation who's hosted two travel shows, impressed Oprah, driven the Mars Rover, and inspired a John Mayer song? (It wasn't "Your Body is a Wonderland.")</p><p> Zach lives by the mantra: when life gives you wheelchair, make lemonade. Whether recounting a valiant childhood attempt to woo Cindy Crawford, encounters with zealous faith healers, or the time he crapped his pants mere feet from Dr. Phil, Zach shares his fumbles with unflinching honesty and characteristic charm. By his thirtieth birthday, Zach had grown into an adult with a career in entertainment, millions of fans, a loving family, and friends who would literally carry him up mountains.<i></i><br><i> </i><br><i> If at Birth You Don't Succeed </i>is a hilariously irreverent and heartfelt memoir about finding your passion and your path even when it's paved with epic misadventure. This is the unlikely but not unlucky story of a man who couldn't safely open a bag of Skittles, but still became a fitness guru with fans around the world. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll fall in love with the Olive Garden all over again, and learn why cerebral palsy is, definitively, "the sexiest of the palsies."</p></p><p><b>Zach Anner </b>is an award-winning comedian, show host, and public speaker.

The South's fighting men served from the time of their enlistment until the end of the war, receiving poor rations, and even worse clothing &#x2013; and this despite the fact that one of the first steps taken by the new army was to design a uniform and establish standards for accoutrements and weapons. In this first of five volumes examining American Civil War armies, Philip Katcher profiles the uniforms issued by the national Confederate government to its artillery, cavalry and infantry troops.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.This title covers the uniforms, arms and personal equipment issued by the national Confederate government to its artillery, cavalry, and infantry.</p><h2>Tranquility: The Piano Solos of Phil Coulter</h2><p>(Music Sales America). 19 arrangements of Phil Coulter&#39;s best-loved songs, including &#34;The Last Rose Of Summer,&#34; &#34;Maggie,&#34; &#34;The Flight of the Earls,&#34; and &#34;The Town I Loved So Well.&#34; These specially transcribed versions make Coulter&#39;s works accessible for most pianists, letting you bring Tranquility home.</p><p></p><h2>Longarm #436: Longarm and the Model Prisoner</h2><p><b>Longarm owes his life to a man in handcuffs...</b><br><br>Mild-mannered postal thief Brian Henry is not about to give Deputy U.S. Marshal Custis Long any trouble on the ride back to Denver for trial.

They had had a late and rather wet evening the night before, and he was feeling the effects of it now. Still, he managed a smile for her.</p><p>Rita. That was her name. She had red hair, enough tit for two women, and a waist that he could almost reach around with his own two hands.</p><p>And reaching around her waist did not seem an altogether bad idea. He settled for the smile and a handful of soft tit.</p><p>Rita&#x2019;s nipple responded almost immediately, turning hard and poking into the palm of his left hand as he squeezed.</p><p>&#x201c;Mmm,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This really is going to be a good morning, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You betcha.&#x201d; Longarm caressed her other tit and gave that nipple a tweak. If he remembered correctly, Rita liked having her tits played with. Last night she had gotten off from him doing no more than sucking her nipple. And the girl flowed pussy juice like a mare giving milk.</p><p>&#x201c;Suck my dick, darlin&#x2019;,&#x201d; he murmured into the pillowy softness of Rita&#x2019;s left tit.</p><p>She giggled and quickly headed in that direction. By the time she arrived, Longarm was erect and ready for her.</p><p>Rita peeled back his foreskin and cupped his balls in the palm of her hand while she ran her tongue around the head of his prick.</p><p>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; he whispered, his voice throaty and a little hoarse.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful dick, sweetheart,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not nice t&#x2019; talk with your mouth full,&#x201d; Longarm said.</p><p>&#x201c;But it isn&#x2019;t in my mouth, sweetheart.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My point exactly,&#x201d; Longarm told her.</p><p>Rita giggled again and dropped her head, engulfing him in the sweet warmth of her mouth. She pushed until she gagged and sucked hard as she withdrew.</p><p>Longarm arched his back to meet her and pressed his head against the pillow, lifting his hips to her.</p><p>Instead of thrusting, though, he held himself rigid, poised with his hips elevated and his cock buried in the heat of Rita&#x2019;s mouth.</p><p>She was able to take nearly all of him, something not too many girls could accomplish. Rita wrapped her lips tight around his shaft and sucked, then pulled back until only the head remained in her mouth. Then she ran the tip of her tongue around and around the head of his cock.</p><p>Suddenly she pushed down again. Hard. Taking him deep. Fast. Out again and just as quickly deep.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep that up, darlin&#x2019;, an&#x2019; you&#x2019;ll get a mouthful,&#x201d; Longarm cautioned.</p><p>Rita kept it up.</p><p>And she did indeed get the promised mouthful.</p><p>Longarm felt the gather and rise of his jism somewhere down in his balls, then the sudden release as it shot up through his shaft and squirted into Rita&#x2019;s throat.</p><p>He cried out with the intensity of his pleasure. Rita stayed with him, swallowing hard and fast to keep up with the flow of Longarm&#x2019;s juice.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn but I do like a girl that swallows,&#x201d; Longarm observed.</p><p>Rita did not answer. But then she had her mouth full at the time and likely felt it would be impolite to speak.</p><p>Only when he was well drained and sucked dry did she finally let his dick slide out from her lips.</p><p>The air that suddenly reached his dick was cold on the lingering wetness.</p><p>Longarm shivered a little and lightly stroked Rita&#x2019;s back and the cheeks of her rounded ass.</p><p>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; she agreed with another giggle.</p><p>Longarm sat up. &#x201c;Now, little darlin&#x2019;, you need t&#x2019; move&#x201d;&#x2014;he slapped her ass hard enough to sting&#x2014;&#x201c;so&#x2019;s I can get up. I gotta get dressed and shaved an&#x2019; whatnot. Unlike some people&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. namely you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&#x2019;t lay around all mornin&#x2019;. I got t&#x2019; go make a living.&#x201d;</p><p>Rita fashioned a pout on her pretty lips. &#x201c;Do you have to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have to.&#x201d; He added, &#x201c;An&#x2019; wipe the cum off your lips.&#x201d; In fact, she had none there, but she could not know that. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and moved to make room so he could crawl out of her bed and collect his share of the clothing that had gotten flung around sometime in the wee hours.</p><p>He bent, gave Rita a quick kiss, and headed off in search of something to eat before he showed up for work.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Deputy United States Marshal Custis Long left his boardinghouse, crossed Cherry Creek, and headed into Denver&#x2019;s downtown district, where the marshal&#x2019;s offices were located in the Federal Building on Colfax Avenue.</p><p>Long was known as Longarm to his friends. And to a fair number of enemies, too.</p><p>He was a tall man, standing over six feet in height, with dark brown hair and a sweeping handlebar mustache. His features were somewhat on the craggy side, and he found them ordinary enough. A good many women, however, thought the deputy more than a little attractive.</p><p>He had broad shoulders, long legs, and large, powerful hands, which were gentle with a horse or a woman but could be rough on a felon who made the mistake of resisting arrest.</p><p>Longarm wore brown corduroy trousers tucked into black knee-high cavalry boots, a brown-and-white-checked shirt, a brown vest with a gold watch chain stretched between the pockets, a brown tweed coat, and a brown flat-crowned Stetson hat.</p><p>His gun belt was black leather and carried its holster just to the left of his belt buckle, the rig canted for a cross-draw.</p><p>The revolver riding in that holster was a .45 caliber double-action Colt with black gutta-percha grips and the bluing beginning to wear off from extended use.</p><p>Longarm passed the United States Mint and crossed the side street to the Federal Building. He mounted the stone steps and opened the door for a gentleman who was coming out.</p><p>He entered the offices of United States Marshal William Vail and tossed a friendly &#x201c;good morning&#x201d; to Vail&#x2019;s chief clerk, Henry, seated at his desk outside the marshal&#x2019;s office.</p><p>&#x201c;Incredible,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re only ten minutes late this morning. That may be a record for early arrival.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was a long wait at the caf� this morning,&#x201d; Longarm said cheerfully as he hung his hat on the rack in a corner.</p><p>&#x201c;Sit down and wait,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;I know the boss will want to see you, but he&#x2019;s busy with some paperwork first, things that have to be done. He shouldn&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm nodded and took a seat on one of the chairs set against the wall. He nudged a spittoon close with the toe of his boot and took a dark, slender cheroot out of his inside coat pocket. He bit the twist off and spit it into the cuspidor, pulled a match from a vest pocket, and snapped it aflame.</p><p>He lit his cigar, blew the match flame out, and dropped the spent match into the cuspidor.</p><p>Then he sat back, content to wait until Billy Vail was ready to see him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>&#x201c;Longarm,&#x201d; Henry said, emerging from Billy&#x2019;s office, his hands full of papers, &#x201c;you can come in now.&#x201d;</p><p>Henry left the door open. Longarm closed it behind him when he went in.</p><p>United States Marshal William Vail sat behind his uncluttered desk, the early morning sunshine giving a shine to his bald head.</p><p>Billy leaned back in his swivel chair and motioned Longarm toward the two chairs that sat in front of the desk. Longarm accepted the offer and settled into the chair on the right.</p><p>&#x201c;Henry tells me you are just aching for an assignment that will take you out of town for a few days,&#x201d; Billy said.</p><p>That was a wild exaggeration. The closest Longarm had come to any such statement was to casually ask Henry if there happened to be an assignment for him. He had said nothing about wanting to get out of Denver. Quite the contrary, he was having a good time in town with the ladies who were part of a newly arrived dance troupe playing at the Jasperanza Theater, last night&#x2019;s companion being one of them.</p><p>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;ll do anything you need, boss,&#x201d; Longarm said.</p><p>He meant that, too. A great many marshals, political appointees all, were mere pencil pushers. But not Vail. Billy had earned the respect his deputies gave him.</p><p>Before becoming a U.S. marshal, Billy had been a Texas Ranger and a good one. Despite his almost angelic appearance, the man was as salty as they came and more than held his own in a gunfight as had been proven many and many a time.</p><p>&#x201c;I do have something here that will give you a little break from city life. Do you know a town called Wyskopf?&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm shook his head. &#x201c;Never heard of it.&#x201d; He crossed his legs and pulled out another cheroot, leaned forward to take a match out of the shot glass full of them on Billy&#x2019;s desk, and lit his smoke.</p><p>&#x201c;To tell the truth, neither had I,&#x201d; Billy said, &#x201c;but the town marshal of Wyskopf wired that he has arrested Brian Henry and wants the hundred-dollar reward posted for the man.</p><p>&#x201c;What I want you to do, Longarm, is to take the reward money to this Wyskopf place and exchange it for the prisoner, then bring Henry back here for trial in Federal court.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm nodded. He remembered the case. Henry was accused of stealing stamps from the post office in Monument, Colorado. That made the theft a Federal crime and put it squarely in the jurisdiction of Billy Vail and his deputies.</p><p>&#x201c;Our Henry knows where that Henry is located,&#x201d; Billy said. &#x201c;He can fill you in on where to go and give you the usual vouchers for meals and lodging. I&#x2019;m told there is stagecoach service to Wyskopf so you should have no trouble getting there and getting Henry back here. Henry, our Henry I mean, will give you all the details.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can leave practically right away, boss. I always keep a bag packed an&#x2019; ready. All I have t&#x2019; do is stop by my boardinghouse an&#x2019; grab it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Now go to it, Long. And good luck.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm stood and touched a finger to his forehead in a salute to the boss. Then he went into the outer office to see Henry and get the rest of his instructions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>There were a number of ways to get to Wyskopf, Longarm discovered, none of them good.</p><p>Wyskopf was situated in the Sawatch Range of the Rockies, not far south of Tincup.</p><p>To reach it, he could travel through Breckenridge and Fairplay, then down Trout Creek Pass into the Arkansas River Valley and up again to Tincup.</p><p>Or he could go south to Colorado Springs and Manitou, up Ute Pass to South Park, and again, down Trout Creek Pass.</p><p>Or he could go the longest, but easiest, route by taking a train south to Pueblo then following the Arkansas upriver to Buena Vista and up to Tincup.</p><p>Any way he looked at it, this was going to be a long trip to pick up Brian Henry.</p><p>Longarm&#x2019;s preparations consisted of buying a fresh supply of cheroots and a bottle of rye to see him through the journey and stopping at his boardinghouse to grab his carpetbag. He left his saddle and Winchester in his room, figuring he would need neither since Wyskopf was served by a coach line.</p><p>Everything considered, Longarm opted to take the train as far as he could, it being infinitely more comfortable than the cramped interior of a stagecoach.</p><p>He took the afternoon southbound and was in Pueblo not long after nightfall.</p><p>When he checked on the Denver &amp; Rio Grande schedule on up the Arkansas River Valley to Buena Vista, the clerk said, &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t have another heading up that way until morning, Marshal. It leaves at eight ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you need a hotel overnight, I recommend the Chesterfield. It&#x2019;s just three blocks east.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm touched the brim of his Stetson and picked up his carpetbag, then turned and headed out of the depot.</p><p>It was still early in the evening. He had plenty of time to check into the hotel and have something to eat. Then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he smiled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then he knew of a mighty nice saloon where the rye whiskey was tops, the card players friendly, and the ladies damned good to look at.</p><p>He lengthened his stride, eager for whatever the night might bring.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>&#x201c;This just isn&#x2019;t my night, boys. I&#x2019;m out.&#x201d; Longarm drained his shot glass and set it on the card table upside down. He pushed back from the table and stood, his knee joints cracking. He gathered up what remained of his cash and dropped the coins into his pocket, then turned and started toward the door.</p><p>His way was blocked by one of the waitresses. He had noticed her even though she was not the girl who was waiting on his table. This one had long, light brown hair, high cheekbones, and huge, sparkling eyes. She also had a more than generous bust, which was not hidden by her low-cut blouse.</p><p>The girl stepped in front of Longarm and planted her hands on her hips.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss,&#x201d; Longarm said, nodding and touching the brim of his hat. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d;</p><p>The girl laughed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t remember me, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should I?&#x201d; And no, he did not remember her, did not think he had ever seen her before or surely he would have remembered a girl this pretty.</p><p>The laughter turned into a giggle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Amy.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm&#x2019;s brow knitted together as he tried to remember. &#x201c;Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Amy, you say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amy Shire.&#x201d; Her laughter rang out again. &#x201c;Of course, the last time you saw me, I was fifteen and skinny as a stick. You helped my family with some problems.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shire,&#x201d; Longarm repeated. Then it came to him and he smiled. &#x201c;Now I remember. They were homesteading down south of here. Your father had some problems with a rancher trying to run him off your land, as I recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; the girl said.</p><p>&#x201c;How is your family now?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Happy. Healthy. Papa proved up on the land this past year, so they own it free and clear. Thanks to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was just doing what was right,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you were the most handsome, wonderful man in the whole world,&#x201d; Amy said. &#x201c;I had a terrible schoolgirl crush on you. I thought about you every night for weeks and weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good thing I didn&#x2019;t know that at the time, you bein&#x2019; only fifteen.&#x201d; He laughed. &#x201c;And skinny as a stick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not fifteen now,&#x201d; Amy said.</p><p>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind me sayin&#x2019; so, you&#x2019;re not skinny anymore either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you noticed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Amy moved closer and lifted her chin so she could peer up into his face. &#x201c;I still have that crush on you, Marshal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t exactly know what t&#x2019; say to that, girl,&#x201d; Longarm told her.</p><p>&#x201c;I can leave here whenever I wish,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not a virgin anymore. Do you have a room we can go to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure &#x2019;bout this?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes. I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; She smiled. She had dimples. &#x201c;Like I told you, I still have that crush on you. But I&#x2019;m not a schoolgirl anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm hesitated while he worked out the math of how long ago that had been since he was at the Shire farm. Amy would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? Twenty or twenty-one by now. And she was certainly woman enough. No longer a virgin, she said.</p><p>He smiled and offered his arm, then stopped and said, &#x201c;Do you want to go out on the street dressed like that, or d&#x2019;you want to change clothes before we go down the street to the Chesterfield?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go like this if I wouldn&#x2019;t embarrass you to be seen on the street with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With a girl as pretty as you?

Rumpole is asked to defend a Pakistani doctor who has been imprisoned without charge or trial on suspicion of aiding Al Qaeda. Meanwhile, on the home front, She Who Must Be Obeyed is threatening to share her intimate view of her husband in a tell-all memoir. The result is Rumpole at his most ironic and indomitable, and John Mortimer at his most entertaining.</p><p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.*Starred Review* Mortimer expanded his Rumpole range from short story to novel form with <i>Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders </i>in 2004. In this, the second full-scale Rumpole novel, Mortimer launches an all-out attack on Britain's Anti-Terror Act, which he characterizes as aiding and abetting terrorists by doing away with the hard-won rule of law. Rumpole's disturbing encounters with the devastations of the Anti-Terror Act come through his bread-and-butter connection with the Timsons, the criminal family who, through the years, has sought Rumpole for their defense. A distant Timson relative now comes to Rumpole. This woman is married to a Pakistani doctor who has been imprisoned on suspicion of terrorism. Rumpole's attempts to free this man are met with horror from Rumpole's wife ("She Who Must Be Obeyed"), disapproval from his colleagues at 4 Equity Court, and disavowal from the Timsons, who drop him as their QC of choice. Rumpole, reduced to offering advice at the Free Legal Clinic, pursues his client's right to a fair trial even as he battles his own doubts about the accused. All the usual Rumpolean marvels of language and characterization are here, with the addition of searing social commentary on racial prejudice and Britain's current government. A bracing, upsetting, inspiring David-and-Goliath Rumpole. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Finding the right door, waiting in line, and using the facilities are often undertaken with trepidation. Don&#x2019;t touch anything. Try not to smell. Avoid eye contact. And for men, don&#x2019;t look down or let your eyes stray. Even washing one&#x2019;s hands are tied to anxieties of disgust and humiliation. And yet other things also happen in these spaces: babies are changed, conversations are had, make-up is applied, and notes are scrawled for posterity.<br>Beyond these private issues, there are also real public concerns: problems of public access, ecological waste, and&#x2014;in many parts of the world&#x2014;sanitation crises. At public events, why are women constantly waiting in long lines but not men? Where do the homeless go when cities decide to close public sites? Should bathrooms become standardized to accommodate the disabled? Is it possible to create a unisex bathroom for transgendered people?<br>In Toilet, noted sociologist Harvey Molotch and Laura Nor�n bring together twelve essays by urbanists, historians and cultural analysts (among others) to shed light on the public restroom. These noted scholars offer an assessment of our historical and contemporary practices, showing us the intricate mechanisms through which even the physical design of restrooms&#x2014;the configurations of stalls, the number of urinals, the placement of sinks, and the continuing segregation of women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s bathrooms&#x2014;reflect and sustain our cultural attitudes towards gender, class, and disability. Based on a broad range of conceptual, political, and down-to-earth viewpoints, the original essays in this volume show how the bathroom&#x2014;as a practical matter&#x2014;reveals competing visions of pollution, danger and distinction.<br>Although what happens in the toilet usually stays in the toilet, this brilliant, revelatory, and often funny book aims to bring it all out into the open, proving that profound and meaningful history can be made even in the can.<br>Contributors: Ruth Barcan, Irus Braverman, Mary Ann Case, Olga Gershenson, Clara Greed, Zena Kamash,Terry Kogan, Harvey Molotch, Laura Nor�n, Barbara Penner, Brian Reynolds, and David Serlin.</p></p><p><b>Harvey Molotch</b> is Professor of Sociology at New York University.

If you do not exclude any category and do not focus too heavily on any category, you will be fine.<br><br>That said, the typical American diet has lost its bearings over the years. Because of the fast pace of living that we all seem caught up in, getting variety in our diets has become a challenge. Fast food, takeout food, and convenience food have thrown our dietary balance out of whack.<br><br>Here's how to get the balance back:<br><br>* Choose whole foods over refined or processed foods whenever possible.<br><br>* Eat more whole grains. This is one of the biggest shortfalls in the American diet.<br><br>* Eat more vegetables, and eat a rainbow of colors, especially the more deeply colored vegetables. They are the highest in antioxidants and other phytochemicals. See "A Short Guide to Phytochemicals".<br><br>* Choose good carbs over bad carbs. This means choosing complex carbohydrates--such as beans, grains, or potatoes--over simple carbohydrates, which are bascially sugars.<br><br>* Consume more fiber-rich foods, especially those high in heart-healthy soluble fiber, such as oats, apples, and beans.<br><br>* Choose good fats over bad fats. This means choosing unsaturated fats, especially mono-unsaturated, over saturated fats. See "Comparative Fats".<br><br>* Try to get protein at every meal. It keeps your metabolism in good working order. The protein can be from animal or plant sources.<br><br>* Choose lean animal sources of protein, with the exception of fish because the fattier species are high in healthful omega-3 fatty acids. See "Omega- 3s in Fish" and "The Cholesterol in Shellfish".<br><br>Eating Organic<br><br>In 1990, Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act. The act required the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop national standards for organically produced agricultural products. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service established something called the National Organic Program (NOP) whose task was to develop the standards and to establish an organic certification program. The NOP came up with a definition for organic (below) and then came up with the requirements for food labels.<br><br>The official definition: To be deemed organic, an agricultural product must be grown without the use of most conventional pesticides, petroleum-based fertilizers, or sewage sludge-based fertilizers. In the case of animals, their feed must comply with the above; in addition the animals must be raised with no growth hormones or antibiotics. The regulations also prohibit genetic engineering, ionizing radiation, and sewage sludge in production and handling. There are also specific regulations about the use of synthetic substances.<br><br>The NOP has defined three label categories that can use the term organic. Only the first two are allowed to bear the official USDA Organic seal.<br><br>100 percent organic: a single ingredient, such as raw fruits and vegetables, produced according to organic regulations; or products with multiple ingredients, each of which must have been organically produced. If any processing aids are used, those too must conform to the definition of organic. Is allowed to bear the USDA Organic seal.<br><br>Organic: must contain by weight (excluding water and salt) at least 95 percent organically produced raw or processed agricultural product. Up to 5 percent of the ingredients may include nonor-ganic ingredients in minor amounts--such as spices, flavors, colorings, oils, vitamins, and minerals. Can bear the USDA Organic seal.<br><br>Made with organic ingredients: for labeling and market information purposes, agricultural products that are multi-ingredient products containing between 70 and 95 percent organic agricultural ingredients by weight or fluid volume (excluding water and salt). May not bear the organic seal.<br><br>For products with less than 70 percent organic ingredients (by weight or fluid volume, excluding water and salt), organic labeling is limited to the information panel only.<br><br>Read the Label<br><br>The main thrust of this book is to avoid as much processed food as possible, but the reality for most of us is that this can't happen 100 percent of the time. So the next best thing is to be label-savvy and understand what information you can glean from a product's packaging.<br><br>Serving size: Before you read the nutrition numbers on the label, be sure you check the serving size. Some packaging is misleading (although the government is cracking down on this).<br><br>Total fat: By law, a food product has to have more than 0.5 gram of fat per serving before the manufacturer has to list it. So if a product says there are a total of 4 servings in the package and each serving has 0 grams of fat, it's conceivable that a serving has .44 grams. If you ate all 4 servings, you'd be getting almost 2 grams of fat. This is one reason some manufacturers alter serving sizes.<br><br>Saturated fat: Check the saturated fat; ideally it should be no more than 33 percent of the total fat.<br><br>Trans fats: These should be nonexistent or as low as possible.<br><br>Vitamins and minerals: Food manufacturers are only required to list vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron percentages on the label's nutrition panel. The absence of other nutrients listed has nothing to do with whether or not they are in the product, though many manufacturers will add that information if their product is particularly high. Also note that the percentages are based on the Daily Value, which is an average of recommended intakes with no respect to gender or age. For example, the Daily Value for calcium is 900 milligrams. If you are a woman over the age of 51, your recommended intake is much higher than that--1,200 milligrams.<br><br>Ingredients list: The ingredients are listed in descending order of weight.<br><br> Allergen alerts: Any product that contains gluten, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, dairy, crustaceans, or sulfites must clearly state the fact; in addition, there must also be an alert if the product was produced in a facility with any of these allergens present.<br><br>A SHORT GUIDE TO PHYTOCHEMICALS<br><br>In the past 10 or 15 years, there has been a sea of change in the world of nutrition in the form of phytochemical research. Phytochemicals are com�ds, found in plants, that are being studied for a whole host of health benefits, from cancer prevention to improved brain function. There is still much research to be done in order to determine exactly how these com�ds can help us, as well as how much of a substance you would have to consume to get a health benefit. This field of study is in its infancy and changes often. This table highlights a tiny fraction of what is being researched (there are thousands and thousands of phytochemicals).<br><br>PHYTOCHEMICAL WHAT IT IS/WHAT IT MAY DO SOME GOOD SOURCES ALLYL SULFIDES Com�ds being studied for anticancer potential Garlic, onion family ALPHA-LINOLENICACID (ALA) An essential fatty acid (EFA) that the body converts to omega-3 fatty acids, which are being studied for their ability to suppress inflammatory com�ds and improve cardio-vascular health Canola oil, flaxseed, walnuts,hemp seed, chia seed ANTHOCYANINS Red and blue pigments found in certain fruits and vegetables; being studied for anticancer potential Berries, plums, pomegranates, red cabbage ANTIOXIDANTS A broad category of com�ds that fight free radicals, which are cell-damaging rogue oxy-gen molecules Lots of foods fall into this category. Some prominent examples include tea and fruits. (See "Antioxidants in Food,".) BETA-CAROTENE An orange food pigment, converted by the body into vitamin A; a powerful antioxidant Carrots, sweet potatoes, dark leafy greens, winter squash BETA-GLUCAN A type of dietary soluble fiber that can lower blood cholesterol Oatmeal, barley, shiitake mushrooms CAPSAICIN The substance that gives chili peppers heat;an antioxidant that may also have antibacterial properties All chili peppers; more in the hottest varieties (see "The Heat in Chilies,".)

Antioxidants are com�ds that are known to eliminate free radicals, which are unstable oxygen molecules implicated in a wide range of health issues, from tumor formation to wrinkling of the skin.

These traditions were not lost but continued, passed down through the ages. Many managed to reach us in post-biblical sources: rabbinic literature, Jewish Hellenistic writings, the writings of the Dead Sea sect, the Aramaic, Greek, Latin, and other ancient translations of the Bible, and even outside the ancient Jewish world in Christian and Islamic texts. The Bible itself sometimes alludes to these traditions, often in surprising contexts.&nbsp;Written in clear and accessible language, this volume presents thirty such traditions. It voyages behind the veil of the written Bible to reconstruct what was told and retold among the ancient Israelites, even if it is &#x201c;not what the Bible tells us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Avigdor Shinan is the Yitzhak Becker Professor of Jewish Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

History and Product begins with an exploration of the history of the corporation from 1936-1945 in a profusely researched and illustrated way.

In the spirit of Plantinga&#x2019;s famous manifesto, &#x201c;Advice to Christian Philosophers,&#x201d; James&nbsp;K.&nbsp;A. Smith here offers not only advice to Pentecostal philosophers but also some Pentecostal advice to Christian philosophers.<br><br>In this inaugural Pentecostal Manifestos volume Smith begins from the conviction that implicit in Pentecostal and charismatic spirituality is a tacit worldview or &#x201c;social imaginary.&#x201d; Thinking in Tongues unpacks and articulates the key elements of this Pentecostal worldview and then explores their implications for philosophical reflection on ontology, epistemology, aesthetics, language, science, and philosophy of religion. In each case, Smith demonstrates how the implicit wisdom of Pentecostal spirituality makes unique contributions to current conversations in Christian philosophy.</p><p>James K. A. Smith is professor of philosophy at Calvin College, where he also teaches in the congregational and ministry studies department.&#x201c;Thinking in Tongues provides both philosophical thinking about Pentecostalism and philosophical thought from a Pentecostal perspective. In both cases the thinking is vintage Jamie Smith: clear, original, and provocative. Non-Pentecostals can be grateful for this analysis of the philosophical importance of this increasingly important strand of Christian thought.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015; C.

What O'Donnell has managed to do here is to get at the heart of the mystery of O'Connor's novels, short stories, essays and letters and to reveal the by turns dark and luminous Catholic faith that sustained and transformed her work throughout her too-brief life. The truth is I could not put O'Donnell's book down until I had read straight through it from beginning to end. It's all here-the scholarship, the critical insights, a Catholic writer's trenchant understanding of another Catholic writer to remind us that the spirit of Merton, Dorothy Day, Walker Percy, and O'Connor herself is alive and well today.<br> Paul Mariani, Boston College<br><br>How refreshing it is to read a biography of Flannery O'Connor that shows a deep understanding of her faith and treats it not as an idiosyncrasy to be dismissed as peripheral but as the primary motivator in her life and art. Professor O'Donnell has written an elegant and multi-dimensional portrayal of O'Connor as `a fellow Catholic-in-exile.' This is a must-read for anyone interested in coming to a full understanding of the ways in which O'Connor's faith was not just the background but the driving force behind her vision.<br> Jill Pel�ez Baumgaertner, Author of <i>Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring</i>, Wheaton College<br><br>Angela Alaimo O'Donnell has written a graceful, compelling biography of Flannery O'Connor whose fiction, she rightfully insists, constituted `the inestimable contribution [she] has made to American Catholic literature, thought, and culture.' A devout Catholic, O'Connor wrote with the same fervor about her faith than she did her craft. Seamlessly moving from the life events in O'Connor's pilgrimage-the places she wrote, the friends she made, the sufferings she endured-into the characters, settings, and symbols of her stories, O'Donnell brings readers into that enlightened nexus where O'Connor's Catholicism explains and extolls her art. O'Donnell's biography is a must read for anyone who wants to understand how and why O'Connor's fiction with its violence, suffering, and mystery emerges from her Roman Catholic faith and practice.<br> Philip C. Kolin, University of Southern Mississippi, Editor, <i>The Southern Quarterly</i><br><br><i>Flannery O'Connor: Fiction Fired by Faith </i>would serve as an excellent introduction to her life and writings for anyone who has heard about Flannery O'Connor and wondered what all the fuss-and fervor-is about.<br> Rose Pacatte, FSP, Author of<i> Martin Sheen: Pilgrim on the Way</i><br><br>This insightful biography explores both the writings of O'Connor and the deep Catholic faith that inspired her many celebrated works of fiction.<br><i>U.S. Catholic</i><br><br>The strength of O'Donnell's book, what makes reading it as enjoyable as dropping in on a senior seminar led by an expert professor, is the deep literary exegesis of O'Connor's work. Many of us have read O'Connor's stories at some point, and probably a visceral impression of the haunted characters remains with us. But O'Donnell plumbs each short story and novel, examples its meanings and relates the themes to profound Christian ones. Drawing on O'Connor's letters, O'Donnell helps the reader understand O'Connor's vocation as an artist and her embrace of her own suffering as a way to draw closer to God.<br> Eileen Markey, <i>America</i><br><br>The O'Connor of this biography is entirely human, a woman with imperfections and limitations, but one who speaks with brilliance and warmth in O'Donnell's unprepossessing analysis. This inexpensive treasure is heartily recommended to academic libraries and all readers.<br><i>Catholic Library World</i></p><h2>Profiles in Leadership: Historians on the Elusive Quality of Greatness</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Though we cannot learn leadership, we can learn from leaders, which is why this volume is so engaging and valuable.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Boston Globe</em></strong></p> What made FDR a more successful leader during the Depression crisis than Hoover? Why was Eisenhower more effective as supreme commander at war than he was as president? Who was Pauli Murray and why was she a pivotal figure in the civil rights movement?<br><br> Find the answers to these questions and more in essays by great historians including Sean Wilentz, Alan Brinkley, Annette Gordon-Reed, Jean Strouse, Frances FitzGerald, and others. Entertaining and insightful individually, taken together the essays address the enduring ingredients of leadership, the focus of an introduction by Walter Isaacson. 13 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Walter Isaacson lives in Washington, DC, where he is the president and CEO of the Aspen Institute. He is the author of acclaimed, best-selling biographies of Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry Kissinger.In a thought-provoking book designed to reconsider the attributes of American leadership, Issacson (Einstein and His Universe), former managing editor of Time and now president of the Aspen Institute, has assembled a group of distinguished historians to address some seminal figures in terms of their vision, principles, flexibility, and pragmatism. Many of the contributors have first-rate r�sum�s in scholarship, letters, and research, including Frances Fitzgerald, Sean Wilentz, Jean Strouse, and Robert Dallek. Quality writing, incisive analysis, and valuable revelations accompany each essay, whether it's Kevin Baker's take on the unpredictable baseball manager John Joseph McGraw, Evan Thomas's emotional deconstruction of Robert F. Kennedy, or Annette Gordon-Reed's perceptive measure of W.E.B. Du Bois. Three standout essays concern the moral and strategic strengths and weaknesses of Gen. George Washington; Joseph, chief of the Nez Perce Indians; and presidents Hoover and FDR. At a time when leadership is lacking, this memorable book culls examples from our past to reveal what makes a person stand above the rest. It's unfortunate that just one of the subjects--civil rights activist Pauli Murray--is a woman. 13 illus. (Oct.) (c) <br>Copyright � PWxyz, LLC.

Fly fishing for pike and their cousins the muskie, the pickerel, and the tiger muskie is one of the sport's great challenges, yet one few have taken up. For the thought of having the top predator in a given body of water (a trout--hallowed quarry of most fly fishing--is just a quick snack for most pike and muskie) chomp a light fly tied to a whippy fly rod can make an angler's knees go weak. Not as well illustrated as one might like--the drawings are rather barren, the photos are mostly of the look-at-me-I-got-a-big-fish variety, and the flies used to tempt the toothy critters should be in color--the text solidly explains the tactics and techniques used to capture these water-wolves. Given that this may be the first and only book on its subject, plan on it for your fishing shelf, if only to please the handful of anglers willing to try this different form of angling. <i>Jon Kartmam</i></p><h2>The Spiritual Anatomy of Emotion: How Feelings Link the Brain, the Body, and the Sixth Sense</h2><p>A cutting-edge examination of feelings, not thoughts, as the gateway to understanding consciousness <br> <br>� Contends that emotion is the greatest influence on personality development <br> <br>� Offers a new perspective on immunity, stress, and psychosomatic conditions <br> <br>� Explains how emotion is key to understanding out-of-body experience, apparitions, and other anomalous perceptions <br> <br>Contemporary science holds that the brain rules the body and generates all our feelings and perceptions.

Thus began the holy wars that would focus the power of Europe against a common enemy and become the stuff of romantic legend. In reality the Crusades were a series of rabidly savage conflicts in the name of piety. And, as Armstrong demonstrates in this fascinating book, their legacy of religious violence continues today in the Middle East, where the age-old conflict of Christians, Jews, and Muslims persists.</p><p>A penetrating narrative history of the Crusades that reveals the ominous links and parallels between those medieval clashes and the violent rivalries of the Middle East today.&#x201c;Ambitious.... <i>Holy War</i> reminds us that no one can understand conflicts like the Persian Gulf War without seeing the spiritual yearnings behind them.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>Detroit Free Press<br></i></p><h2>The Metastases of Enjoyment: On Women and Causality (Radical Thinkers)</h2><p>The experience of the Yugoslav war and the rise of &#x201c;irrational&#x201d; violence in contemporary societies provides the theoretical and political context of this book, which uses Lacanian psychoanalysis as the basis for a renewal of the Marxist theory of ideology.

This study concentrates on the ferocious battles between the German Panzer IV and US Sherman that were at the heart of this decisive phase of World War II. The two types were among the most-produced tanks in US and German service and were old enemies - having clashed repeatedly in the Mediterranean theater. Throughout their long service careers, both had seen a succession of technical developments and modifications, as well as an evolution in their intended roles - but both remained at the forefront of the fighting on the Western Front. Written by an expert on armoured warfare, this book invites the reader into the cramped confines of these armoured workhorses, employing vivid technical illustrations alongside archive and contemporary photography to depict the conditions for the crewmen within.</p><p>Steven J.

In this well-annotated text, Mr. Chernev guides his readers to an understanding of the subtleties of combinative play.<br>Step-by-step from the simplest combinations to the most complex, the book explains the intricacies of pins and counter-pins, Knight forks, smothered mates, and other elements of combination play. There is a discussion in chapter&nbsp;five of combinations lurking in roads not taken &#x2014; alternate lines of play show up in Chernev's notes to the game, while the sixth chapter, "Convincing the Kibitzers," shows the second-guessers what would have happened had the masters done the obvious.

A host of boomerangs follow &#x2014; cases where the player didn't look far enough ahead and his combination, instead of bringing about the opponent's ruin, paved the way to his defeat.

In fact, Ross Douthat of <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> wrote that "if Aslan had actually written in defense of the Islamic view of Jesus, that would have been something provocative and new."<br><br>Mustafa Akyol's <i>The Islamic Jesus</i> is that book&nbsp;-- and even much more.<br>&nbsp;<br>For<i> The Islamic Jesus</i> not only tells the story of Jesus, and his mother Mary, as narrated in the Qur'an. It also explores how this Islamic picture of the Nazarene resonates with pre-existing Christian sources, especially Apocrypha. In particular, it unveils the fascinating similarity between Islam and "Jewish Christianity," a strain in the early church that got branded as a heresy. <br>&nbsp;<br>Jewish Christians were observant Jews who honored Jesus as a human -- not divine -- Messiah, and sought salvation by faith and works, not "by faith alone." Akyol shows how their peculiar creed vanished in history after the first few Christian centuries, but only to be reborn in 7th century Arabia by a new prophet named Muhammad. This provokes puzzling questions about the origins of Islam, and the Abrahamic&nbsp;genealogy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Islamic Jesus</i> also offers an "Islamic Christology," and probes into Muslim beliefs on the "Second Coming." Perhaps most provokingly, it even contemplates, "What Jesus can teach Muslims today" -- at a&nbsp;time, Akyol argues, when Muslims are haunted by their own Herods, Pharisees and Zealots.</p><p>MUSTAFA AKYOL is a regular columnist for the <i>Hurriyet Daily News</i>, <i>Al-Monitor.com</i>, and the <i>International New York Times</i>. His book, <i>Islam without Extremes</i>, has been reviewed and quoted by <i>The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Washington Post, </i><i>NPR, The Guardian, National Review, </i>and <i>Washington Times</i>. Akyol has appeared on Fareed Zakaria&#x2019;s <i>GPS</i> on CNN, <i>Hardtalk</i> on BBC, and TED.com. <i>Islam without Extremes </i>was long-listed for the 2012 Lionel Gelber Prize literary prize.<p><em>"The Islamic Jesus </em>is about so much more than Islam or Jesus. It&#x2019;s about the very bridge that connects Jews and Christians with the followers of Mohammad. Regardless of whether he&#x2019;s a Jewish radical or a Christian Messiah, Jesus is also one of the most beloved prophets in Islam. In this book, Mustafa Akyol expertly distills the Jesus persona and the role it plays in all three religions. This is a profound contribution in proving that Judaism and Christianity are not adversaries to Muslims, but rather intrinsic parts of the entire Islamic belief system." &#x2015;Reza Aslan, author of <em>No god but God </em>and <em>Zealot</em><br></p> <p>"Interfaith dialogue is undoubtedly an admirable way of advancing tolerance and understanding. But removing one&#x2019;s 'military boots' and stepping into the proverbial shoes of another religious conviction in order to ask 'what can Jesus teach Muslims today?' is the preferred way of this book, which I applaud unequivocally. Akyol&#x2019;s proposition to discern the Islamic Jesus through the early apocryphal literature uncannily echoes the Orthodox Church&#x2019;s priority to illuminate the Gospel Jesus through the eastern liturgical tradition." &#x2015;Rev. Dr. John Chryssavgis, Archdeacon of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and author of <em>Bartholomew: Apostle and Visionary</em></p> <p>"This work helps Westerners, especially Christians, to gain more insight into the Islamic understanding of Jesus - upon whom be peace- and also into why, while he is so highly venerated in Islam, he is not divinized as he is in Christianity but remains a prophet." &#x2015;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Professor of Islamic Studies, The George Washington University</p> <p>"Anyone interested in the deeper relationship between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam will learn much from Mustafa Akyol&#x2019;s thoughtful, clearly written, and well researched analysis of how Jewish beliefs and practiced carried over into Christianity, Christian themes were preserved by some Jewish groups, and both, but especially Christianity, were received in Islam. Drawing upon accepted Christian Scriptures as well as lesser known apocryphal writings and related sources, Akyol makes a compelling case for recognizing more common ground among the three faiths than has been heretofore acknowledged. His compelling book is a must read for friends and foes of the Children of Abraham theme." &#x2015;Charles Butterworth, Emeritus Professor, Department of Government &amp; Politics, University of Maryland</p> <p>"In this highly readable and provocative book, Mustafa Akyol establishes the unique role played by Jesus within the Islamic tradition. Most importantly, Akyol turns radical revisionist arguments on their head to make the compelling case that Jesus&#x2019; life when properly understood confirms the Islamic belief that there is no inherent contradiction between the Biblical and Qur&#x2019;anic worldviews. From this vantage point, Jesus does not divide the Abrahamic religions but reconciles them, a message much needed in our divisive times." &#x2015;Asma Afsaruddin, Professor of Islamic Studies, Indiana University</p> <p>"Whether one agrees or disagrees with the historical nuances Akyol presents, one can certainly applaud his significant effort to call people of the respective faith traditions away from the 'us-versus-them' mentality to not only exploring common ground but a respectful exploration of how each of us fit into the larger story of God&#x2019;s interaction throughout human history. His focus on the <em>message</em> of the Christ rather than on the <em>nature</em> of the Christ, is a helpful focus towards interaction which can benefit all. Further, his cultivation of a space of Abrahamic soil &#x2013; the 'Abrahamic archetype' &#x2013; upon which we can come together and benefit in a mutual sharing of faith, points a direction worth pursuing... <em>The Islamic Jesus</em> is a read worth the consideration of those from both the Biblically based faith tradition and the Qur'anic based faith tradition who are serious about their faith and their relations with people of other faiths." &#x2015;Jerald Whitehouse, former director of the Global Center for Adventist Muslim Relations of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists</p> <p>"<em>The Islamic Jesus</em> is a learned and thought-provoking exploration of the figure of Jesus in Islam. Mustafa Akyol develops a measured and distinctive argument of how the Islamic understanding of Jesus is connected to Judaism and Christianity. At the same time he challenges readers to consider how earlier religious controversies, and the figure of Jesus himself, might offer guidance for Islam today." &#x2015;Gabriel Said Reynolds, Professor of Islamic Studies and Theology, University of Notre Dame</p> <p>"Mustafa Akyol is the kind of public intellectual our fractured world needs. He is anchored in a specific tradition but also capable of engaging others with nuance, humility, and good will. In this timely and important book, Akyol provides an insightful account of an Islamic Jesus and a wonderful resource for anyone interested in Abrahamic dialogue." &#x2015;John Barton, PhD, Director of the Center for Faith and Learning, Pepperdine University</p></p><h2>Reflexion</h2><p>Lynette Fromme Memoir Published <p> The Peasenhall Press proudly announces the publication of <i>Reflexion</i>, by Lynette Fromme.

This book contains 400 questions to test the knowledge of any Harry Potter fan. From questions even a muggle should know all the way through to trivia that would test Dumbledore himself, this is an excellent way to enjoy the wizarding world even more.

Packed with vital information about how to prepare yourself (mentally and physically) and your surroundings for attack, the <i>Zombie Survival Manual</i> will also include advice on how to flourish in a post-apocalyptic world. Accompanied by illustrations, maps, diagrams and step-by-step instructions, this manual will be essential reading for those interested in protecting themselves, their families and society at large from the living dead.</p></p><p><p>Sean T Page is a self-proclaimed zombie survivalist. His degree from the London School of Economics has given him the skills and confidence to advise government and other public bodies on what to do in the event of a zombie apocalypse. He launched the Ministry of Zombies in 2009 and has published The Official Zombie Handbook and War Against the Walking Dead.</p>"This is the book that will set you straight as to which zombie movies are &#x201c;factually&#x201d; spot-on and which ones will get your ass killed if you believe them. Fun fact: zombies generally don&#x2019;t run, but the freshest of the newly-turned will be much quicker than those already beginning to decompose. It is this kind of myth-building that will be the most interesting to zombie buffs, and which raises the book above a mere novelty and adds a storytelling dimension, like a documentary-style horror film that uses the conventions of nonfiction film to add a layer of realism. Not that the book is a narrative story in any traditional sense, nor is it scary in any way. It&#x2019;s a tongue-in-cheek, strictly-for-entertainment coffee table book, not meant to be devoured zombie-style, but casually consumed in bite-sized chunks. That said, it&#x2019;s awfully hard to put down once you&#x2019;ve started. That it is rich in backstory will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with Sean T. Page&#x2019;s other work. Prior to this manual, he has released two other zombie apocalypse preparedness handbooks, and a number of zombie-themed short stories and novels. This is someone who has spent a lot of time contemplating a ghoul-infested end of times. The Zombie Survival Manual is a bit of a departure for Page, not thematically, of course, but in format. This Haynes Manual is heavily illustrated with infographic-style vector art and diagrams perfectly suited for the medium he is imitating." -&nbsp;<b><i>From&nbsp;Midnight&nbsp;With Love</i></b></p><h2>Hiking the Southwest&#39;s Geology: Four Corners Region</h2><p><br><br><i>Hiking the Southwest's Geology: Four Corners Region</i> takes curious hikers on a journey through time that explores the Colorado Plateau -- an immense land of canyons, mesas, and isolated mountain ranges in the American Southwest.<br>Divided into representative geologic provinces/areas, author Ralph Hopkins specifies distinct geologic or scenic features and provides information about what makes each province unique.

These stories are set variously in the gas-lit streets of post-war Prague; on the raucous and dangerous factory floor of the famous Poldi steelworks where Hrabal himself once worked; in a cacophonous open-air dance hall where classical and popular music come to blows; at the basement studio where a crazed artist attempts to fashion a national icon; on the scaffolding around a decommissioned church.

Her short stories have been commissioned by BBC Radio, and she writes for <i>The Guardian</i>, with a special interest in Nigeria.<p>Evening swept through the Delta: half an hour of mauve before the sky bruised to black. It was Chike Ameobi&#x2019;s twelfth month as an o&#xfb03;cer in Bayelsa, twelve months on the barren army base. His first sight of the base had been on an evening like this, bumping through miles of bush, leaves pushing through the open window, insects flying up his nostrils and down the dark passages of his ears. They came to a clearing of burnt soil with charred stumps still rooted in it. Out of this desolation had risen the grey walls of his new home. Later, he would note the birds perched on the loops of barbed wire wheeling round the base. He would spot the garganeys and ruffs gliding through the sky, their long migration from Europe almost over.</p> <p>He had grown quite fond of the canteen he was making his way to now, a low, squat building with thick plastic sheets tacked to the windows, the walls crumbling with damp. O&#xfb03;cers and lower ranks sauntered into the building in an assortment of mufti: woollen bobble hats and black T-shirts, wrappers knotted over the arm or tied round the waist, the slovenly slap of slippers flip-flopping their way inside.</p> <p>Colonel Benatari sat by the door, watching the soldiers file past. Chike&#x2019;s commanding o&#xfb03;cer was a stocky box of a man, his bulk filling the head of his table. The most senior o&#xfb03;cers on the base flanked the Colonel. They ate from a private stash of food cooked separately in the kitchen. There was always a struggle to clear the Colonel&#x2019;s table, lower ranks jostling for the remnants of fresh fish and the dregs of wine left over in the bell-shaped crystal glasses.</p> <p>Chike threaded his way through the hall, edging past square wooden tables and round plastic ones, past benches, stools and armless chairs, no piece of furniture matched to another. His platoon was already seated. He was in charge of twenty-three men, charged to lead them in battle and inspect their kit, to see to their hygiene and personal grooming. They were all still in uniform, not a single button undone. When he sat down, they stretched their hands, the clenched fists of their salutes blooming like doorknobs on each wrist. The conversation did not stop.</p> <p>&#x2018;O boy, you see Tina today? That her bobby.&#x2019;v </p><p>&#x2018;What of her nyash?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Like drum.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I go beat am.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Nah me go beat am first.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;You think she go &#x2019;gree for you?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Why she no go &#x2019;gree?&#x2019;</p> <p>Tina was a new kitchen worker. His men could talk of little else these days. Chike too had opinions on whether Tina was more beautiful than &#x1ecc;m&#x1ecd;t&#x1ecd;la but he knew not to add to these conversations. If he spoke, they would listen politely and then continue, a column of ants marching round a boulder.</p> <p>Still he ate dinner with them instead of joining the junior o&#xfb03;cers&#x2019; table. He felt an o&#xfb03;cer should know the men he was in charge of even though these soldiers under his command would rather not be known. They obeyed his orders but questions about their lives and families were met with a silent hostility. His only friend was Private Y&#x1eb9;mi &#x1ecc;k&#x1eb9;, the lowest-ranked man in his platoon, now seated next to him and eating his beans without bothering to pick out the weevils. It was the fourth day in a row they were eating beans and dodo but Y&#x1eb9;mi did not seem to mind.</p> <p>&#x2018;Did you shoot today?&#x2019; Chike whispered to him. &#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Good. Meet me by the generator hut when you finish.&#x2019; There were a few slices of dodo left on Chike&#x2019;s plate, overripe and soggy with oil. Y&#x1eb9;mi would eat them before coming. Chike left the canteen and went outside to wait for his friend.</p></p><h2>Trump&#39;s America: The Truth about Our Nation&#39;s Great Comeback</h2><p><b>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Understanding Trump</i>, this "essential" book reveals the truth about the Trump presidency and explains his groundbreaking plans for our nation and world (Rush Limbaugh).</b><br>No one understands the "Make America Great Again" effort with more insight and experience than former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.

But in this groundbreaking book, prize-winning historian Edith Sheffer exposes that Asperger was not only involved in the racial policies of Hitler&#x2019;s Third Reich, he was complicit in the murder of children.</p><p>As the Nazi regime slaughtered millions across Europe during World War Two, it sorted people according to race, religion, behavior, and physical condition for either treatment or elimination. Nazi psychiatrists targeted children with different kinds of minds&#x2015;especially those thought to lack social skills&#x2015;claiming the Reich had no place for them. Asperger and his colleagues endeavored to mold certain "autistic" children into productive citizens, while transferring others they deemed untreatable to Spiegelgrund, one of the Reich&#x2019;s deadliest child-killing centers.</p><p>In the first comprehensive history of the links between autism and Nazism, Sheffer uncovers how a diagnosis common today emerged from the atrocities of the Third Reich. With vivid storytelling and wide-ranging research, <em>Asperger&#x2019;s Children</em> will move readers to rethink how societies assess, label, and treat those diagnosed with disabilities.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p><blockquote>"This is a revelatory, haunting biography of a gifted practitioner who chose to fall in line with the Nazi regime and the far-reaching consequences of that choice, for his own patients and for those still using and being labeled with the diagnostic concepts he originated." -- <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>, starred review<br> ~ ~<br>"This book is sensational, although its author does not seek sensation.&nbsp;It is a careful work of history, connecting the career of a physician with the intellectual, medical, and political contexts of Austria in the 1930s and 1940s.&nbsp;That world is not our world, but the connections, the habits of mind, speech, diagnosis, are more powerful than we think.&nbsp; In restoring history to psychology, Sheffer helps us to understand why we classify our children the way we do, and helps us to ask, as we must, just what kind of world we are making for them." -- Timothy Snyder, author of&nbsp;<i>On Tyranny&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Bloodlands</em><br></i></blockquote><blockquote><i>"<em>Asperger's Children</em>&nbsp;brings conceptual clarity and badly needed historical depth to a contemporary topic of ever-widening resonance and concern.

An important, well-written, and extremely timely book." -- Sander L. Gilman, author of&nbsp;<em>Seeing the Insane</em><br></i></blockquote><blockquote><i>"This revealing book is magnificently written and researched; it also reflects profound thinking about the origins of autism in medical, historical, and cultural terms." -- Norman M.

This hugely unique and influential album deserves close analysis from a fan, rather than a musicologist. Novelist Alan Warner details the concrete music we hear on the album, how it was composed, executed and recorded--including the history of the album in terms of its release, promotion and art work. This tale of <i>Tago Mago </i>is also the tale of a young man obsessed with record collecting in the dark and mysterious period of pop music before Google. Warner includes a backtracking of the history of the band up to that point and also some description of Can's unique recording approach taking into account their home studio set up.</p><p>Interviews with the two surviving members: drummer Jaki Liebezeit, keyboardist Irmin Schmidt and bassist Holger Czukay make this a hilariously personal and illuminating picture of Can.</p></p><p><p><b>Alan Warner</b> is a Scottish novelist. His 1995 novel <i>Morvern Callar</i> won the Somerset Maugham Award and was made into a feature film directed by Lynne Ramsay. In 2013, he was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel <i>The Deadman's Pedal</i>.</p>&#x201c;In high school, I came upon the book Twilight of the Gods by Wilfred Mellers, a 1973 study attempting to explain the importance of the Fab Four&#x2019;s music through a musicological analysis of their works. This seemed extremely absurd. I recently realized, after reading several books in the 33 1/3 series, that it&#x2019;s not really about the individual albums profiled&#x2015;it&#x2019;s about what it&#x2019;s like to be a fan. It&#x2019;s about what it&#x2019;s like to view a particular work as the pinnacle of aesthetic accomplishment&#x2015;to experience the unique sensation of &#x201c;This speaks to me!&#x201d; There is also a fetishization of the vinyl album as an art object. Each band and record in the series is mythologized as much as the authors&#x2019; experience of discovering them is; in the case of Can&#x2019;s 1971 album Tago Mago, Warner describes their &#x201c;stoner athleticism.&#x201d; The Scottish novelist realizes the absurdity of this linguistic attempt to describe music, as much as Mellers, but Warner&#x2019;s volume about the German psychedelic band is rich because he shows how &#x201c;Tago Mago gave me permission to dream.&#x201d; Tago Mago, along with a number of other Can masterpieces, will be reissued on vinyl alongside the release of the 33 1/3 book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>SLUG Magazine</i></p><h2>Quiet Confidence for a Woman&#39;s Heart: The Power of God&#39;s Restoration and Healing</h2><p><p>This inspiring devotional journey through Psalm 23 encourages women to walk ever more closely with God.

With exclusive access to all those closest to Diana, Sarah Bradford now casts aside the gossip and lies and takes us to the very heart of the royal family to separate the myth from the truth of the Diana years. With the authority missing from previous accounts, as well as remarkable new sources, <i>Diana</i> delivers a complex and explosive look at a woman who continues to fascinate.</p><p>Sarah Bradford is a historian and biographer.

The writing ranges from undistinguished to awkward, but isn't, as in the case of some celeb bios, actually awful. Kellgren's reading, somewhat too good for the text, serves to dress it up. She modulates her voice with sensitivity, expressing sympathy or regret where appropriate, which is often, but keeps at a cool observer's distance from the sometimes tawdry details. She stays true to the text, which is understanding of Diana, but not overly censorious of Prince Charles or his paramour, Camilla. This sad story is here adequately written and well read.

Bush gained reelection by wooing religiously devout "values voters," it was clear that church-state matters in the United States had reached a crisis. With<i> Divided by God</i>, Noah Feldman shows that the crisis is as old as this country--and looks to our nation's past to show how it might be resolved. </p><p>Today more than ever, ours is a religiously diverse society: Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist as well as Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish. And yet more than ever, committed Christians are making themselves felt in politics and culture.</p><p>What are the implications of this paradox? To answer this question, Feldman makes clear that again and again in our nation's history diversity has forced us to redraw the lines in the church-state divide. In vivid, dramatic chapters, he describes how we as a people have resolved conflicts over the Bible, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the teaching of evolution through appeals to shared values of liberty, equality, and freedom of conscience. And he proposes a brilliant solution to our current crisis, one that honors our religious diversity while respecting the long-held conviction that religion and state should not mix. </p><p><i>Divided by God</i> speaks to the headlines, even as it tells the story of a long-running conflict that has made the American people who we are.</p></p><p>In Divided By God, Noah Feldman examines the unique, fascinating balance the United States has pursued for well over 200 years now -- the attempt at democratic government by the people in a country made up of many religions, and many highly religious people. The novel principle enshrined to help make this a success was strong separation of church from state. The strain on the system has never been greater as polarization grows over the many hot-button topics of our day. Feldman also observes how the stakes have been raised in the last 50 years as the forces of secularism have fought a largely successful battle to remove religious symbolism from the public sphere, while at the same time the growing tide of religious conservatism has managed to forge a surprisingly close church-state relationship through government funding of religious priorities (faith-based initiatives and school vouchers, for example.) <p> Feldman, a law professor at New York University, delivers a timely book that attempts to move the discussion past rhetoric, by a careful examination of the history of church-state separation. The book's lively, conversational writing makes for a fascinating journey, starting with a precise analysis of exactly why our founding fathers debated and finally agreed to formally separate church and state, and then tracking the tests and challenges that separation has stood over the last two centuries. Perhaps the most refreshing current throughout is Feldman's lack of partisan bias, and his respect and understanding of the values, fears and goals that successive generations have brought to all sides of this never-ending debate. </p><p> It is that lack of partisanship that makes his conclusion all the more powerful -- a call to move beyond a battlefield where the secular and religious forces aggressively pursue their own mutually exclusive goals, and instead to seek a deeper understanding of what values we all hold in common, and to recognize the importance of engaging in constructive debate in order to find and define that commonality together. --<i>Ed Dobeas</i></p><p><b>Noah Feldman</b>, who teaches law at New York University, is the author of <i>After Jihad</i> and <i>What We Owe Iraq</i>.

Muslims dominate or nearly dominate many important European cities, including Amsterdam and Rotterdam, Strasbourg and Marseille, the Paris suburbs and East London, and in those cities Islam has challenged the European way of life at every turn, becoming, in effect, an &#x201c;adversary culture.&#x201d; In <i>Reflections on the Revolution in Europe</i>, Caldwell examines the anger of natives and newcomers alike. He exposes the strange ways in which welfare states interact with Third World customs, the anti-Americanism that brings European natives and Muslim newcomers together, and the arguments over women and sex that drive them apart. He considers the appeal of sharia, &#x201c;resistance,&#x201d; and jihad to a second generation that is more alienated from Europe than the first, and addresses a crisis of faith among native Europeans that leaves them with a weak hand as they confront the claims of newcomers.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CALDWELL is a columnist for the <i>Financial Times, </i>a contributing writer for the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, and a senior editor at the<i> Weekly Standard. </i>He lives in Washington, D.C.<b>Chapter 1: Rivers of Blood</b><br><br><i>The rights and wrongs of Enoch Powell&#x2014;How much immigration is there?&#x2014;Muslim immigration&#x2014;Europe's population problem&#x2014;Civilization and decadence&#x2014; Diversity is overrated&#x2014;Can you have the same Europe with different people?</i><br><br>Western Europe became a multiethnic society in a fit of absence of mind. Mass immigration began&#x2014;with little public debate, it would later be stressed&#x2014;in the decade after the Second World War. Industries and government in Britain, France, Germany, the Low Countries, and Scandinavia set up programs to recruit manpower to their booming postwar economies. They invited immigrants. Some of the newcomers took positions, particularly in heavy industry, that now look enviably secure and well-paid. But others worked in the hardest, most thankless, and most dangerous occupations that European industry had to offer. Many had been loyal colonial subjects, and had even borne arms for European powers. <br><br>Europe became a destination for immigration as a result of consensus among its political and commercial elites. Those elites, to the extent they thought about the long-term consequences at all, made certain assumptions: Immigrants would be few in number. Since they were coming to fill short-term gaps in the labor force, most would stay in Europe only temporarily. Some might stay longer. No one assumed they would ever be eligible for welfare. That they would retain the habits and cultures of southern villages, clans, marketplaces, and mosques was a thought too bizarre to entertain.<br><br>Almost all of the assumptions with which mass immigration began proved false. As soon as they did, Europe's welcome to the world's poor was withdrawn&#x2014;at first ambiguously, through the oratory of a few firebrand politicians in the 1960s, then explicitly through hard-line legislation against immigration in the 1970s. Decade in, decade out, the sentiment of Western European publics, as measured by opinion polls, has been resolutely opposed to mass immigration. But that is the beginning, not the end of our story. The revocation of Europe's invitation to immigrants, no matter how explicit it became, did little to stem their arrival. As the years passed, immigration to Europe accelerated. At no point were Europeans invited to assess its long-term costs and benefits.<br><br><b><br>The rights and wrongs of Enoch Powell</b><br><br>On April 20, 1968, two weeks after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the race riots that it sparked in Washington and other U.S. cities, the British Tory parliamentarian Enoch Powell made a speech at the Midland Hotel in Birmingham that has haunted the European political imagination ever since. Powell was talking about the arrival, modest up to that point, of "coloured" former colonial subjects, primarily from the Indian subcontinent but also from the Caribbean. At the time, this migration had changed the face of only a very limited number of urban neighborhoods. Powell implied that the long-term consequence would be ghettoes like the ones in America that were burning as he spoke. "We must be mad," he said, "literally mad, as a nation, to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependants, who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre." Citing the poet Virgil, Powell warned, "I seem to see 'the River Tiber foaming with much blood.'"<br><br>Half a year later, in the course of an even more ominous speech to the Rotary Club of London, he warned that, should immigration proceed at the current pace,<br><br>"the urban part of whole towns and cities in Yorkshire, the Midlands and the Home Counties would be preponderantly or exclusively Afro-Asian in population. There would be several Washingtons in England. From those whole areas the indigenous population, the people of England, who fondly imagine that this is their country and these are their home-towns, would have been dislodged&#x2014;I have deliberately chosen the most neutral word I could find. And here for the first time this morning I offer a subjective judgement . . . The people of England will not endure it."<br><br>All British discussion of immigration since then has been, essentially, an argument over whether Enoch Powell was right. It has been a sterile argument because those who engage in it tend to mix up two senses of the word <i>right&#x2014;</i>the moral sense and the factual sense. To say the Emancipation Proclamation is right means something different than to say the Pythagorean theorem is right. Powell's remarks revealed a class-based split over which of these two kinds of rightness is the real business of politics. This split is a feature of all discussions of modern immigration in all countries. <br><br>Political elites focused on whether Powell was right morally. Even if most of the fears Powell appealed to were legitimate ones, and even if plenty of evidence can be mustered (such as his passion for India and for Indian languages) to show that Powell was not himself a racist, his speech can be defended against charges of bigotry only by splitting hairs. News coverage ran against him. Tory leader Ted Heath, Powell's archrival within the party, forced Powell to resign his position as shadow defense minister. Morally, Powell was not right. <br><br>Popular opinion, though, focused on whether he was right factually. And in this sense, right he was, beyond any shadow of a doubt. Although at the time Powell's demographic projections were much snickered at, they have turned out not just roughly accurate but as close to perfectly accurate as it is possible for any such projections to be: In his Rotary Club speech, Powell shocked his audience by stating that the nonwhite population of Britain, barely over a million at the time, would rise to 4.5 million by 2002. (According to the national census, the actual "ethnic minority" population of Britain in 2001 was 4,635,296.) At a speech during the 1970 election campaign, he told voters in Wolverhampton that between a fifth and a quarter of their city, of Birmingham, and of Inner London would consist of Commonwealth immigrants and their descendants. (According to the 2001 census, Wolverhampton is 22.2 percent, Birmingham 29.6 percent, and Inner London 34.4 percent nonwhite.) <br><br>Ordinary Britons loved Powell's Birmingham speech. He received literally vanloads of mail&#x2014;100,000 letters in the ten days that followed, of which only 800 expressed disagreement. Yet if Powell was right that immigration would increase far beyond what an Englishman of 1968 would have considered tolerable, he was wrong to predict that Englishmen of the next generation would not tolerate it. Although blood has indeed flowed at times&#x2014;a spate of racist murders of South Asians in the East End of London in the 1970s, a dozen major riots over the decades, and numerous terrorist plots, including the 7/7 transport bombings carried out by Islamist Englishmen of Pakistani descent in 2005&#x2014;it has not made the rivers foam. What did Powell miss? <br><br>One thing he missed was shame. The dominant moral mood of postwar Europe was one of repentance for two historic misdeeds, colonialism and Nazism. It is true that Britain, uniquely among Western European countries, had no cause to feel penitence for having perpetrated, encouraged, or watched passively the outrages of fascism two and three decades before. Britain had, however, recently dissolved, or been chased from, the largest empire in the history of the world, which left most of its citizens feeling embarrassed and diffident. Powell was an exception. A lover of the old Empire, swept up in the romance of it, he had no ear for this dirge of repentance, and no sense that his contemporaries were hearing a different music. <br><br>When addressing Africans, Asians, and other would-be immigrants, postwar Europeans felt a sense of moral illegitimacy that deepened as the decades passed. The dominant mood was summed up in <i>The March</i>, a fictional movie that BBC 1 aired for "One World Week" in 1990. In it, a charismatic political leader called El-Mahdi leads a quarter of a million people out of a Sudanese refugee camp on a 3,000-mile march to Europe under the slogan "We are poor because you are rich"&#x2014;a message the movie made little effort to contradict. <br><br>Even those who felt that such shame was misplaced were forced to admit its power. In <i>The Camp of the Saints</i>, the dark 1973 novel of the Frenchman Jean Raspail, a collection of philanthropists and activists incite a million underfed Indians to board a flotilla of rusty ships for Europe, with dire consequences, including the trampling to death of the well-wishers who rush to welcome the disembarking hordes. Raspail's vision captures more of the complexity of the modern world than does <i>The March</i>. Political clashes are provoked not just by simple inequalities but by accidents, the vanity of intellectual elites, and the snowball effect of the mass media. What the BBC's filmmakers saw as conscience, Raspail saw as a mix of cowardice and unintended consequences. <br><br>For Powell, as for Raspail, mass migration into Europe was not a matter of individual migrants "looking for a better life," as the familiar phrase goes. It was a matter of organized masses <i>demanding</i> a better life, a desire with radically different political consequences. "It is much nearer to the truth," Powell said, "to think in terms of detachments from communities in the West Indies or India or Pakistan encamped in certain areas of England." Detachments, encampments--these are military metaphors. Powell is wrong to use them. But even if immigrants are not acting collectively, individual decisions to migrate can, in an age of globalization, produce massive collective effects.&nbsp; As the German poet and essayist Hans Magnus Enzensberger wrote in 1992:<br><br>"The free movement of capital brings the free movement of labor in its wake. With the globalization of the world economy, which has been fully achieved only in the very recent past, migratory movements will take on a new quality, too. Government-organized colonial wars, campaigns of conquest, and expulsions will most likely be replaced by molecular mass migrations."<br><br>If one abandons the idea that Western Europeans are rapacious and exploitative by nature, and that Africans, Asians, and other would-be immigrants are inevitably their victims, then the fundamental difference between colonization and labor migration ceases to be obvious.<br><b>How much immigration is there?</b><br><br>Europe is now, for the first time in its modern history, a continent of migrants. Of the 375 million people in Western Europe, 40 million are living outside their countries of birth. In almost all Western European countries, the population of immigrants and their children approaches or surpasses 10 percent. Even the historically poor and backward countries of peripheral Catholic Europe, such as Ireland (14.1 percent immigrant) and Spain (11.1 percent), have become crossroads. Between 2000 and 2005, Ireland's foreign-born population was increasing at an average annual rate of 8.4 percent and Spain's at (what follows is not a typographical error) 21.6 percent a year. <br><br>But we must make a sharp distinction. Much of this movement&#x2014;that part that involves Europeans moving to other European countries&#x2014;is not really immigration at all. It is a program of increased labor and residential mobility explicitly agreed to, through treaties, by the more than two dozen states that are part of the European Union. The EU's members have pledged themselves to an "ever closer union." The so-called "Schengen agreements," ratified in the decade after 1985, permit free movement of residents across most of Europe's internal borders, with no checks or passport controls. <br><br>It is not such a big deal that a third (37 percent) of Luxembourg's residents were born abroad. Virtually all of them were born in the EU: Portugal, France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy are the most important sending countries. Luxembourg is a charter member of the European Union and one of the most loyal. And a Pole who moves to Ireland&#x2014;as about 63,000 have done since the turn of the century, to the point where 2 percent of the island's population is Polish born&#x2014;isn't just moving out of one country and into another. He is moving around within a federation. <br><br>The EU is not unanimously loved in Europe, and movement between EU countries is not popular&#x2014;78 percent of Irish people, for instance, want to reimpose restrictions on Eastern European immigration. Such mobility erodes national cultures that have shaped and comforted people for centuries and it does so no matter who is doing the moving. For instance, the Swedish sociologist �ke Daun has often written about how Swedes "like being like each other." Most peoples do, and they have a harder time being so when their countries fill up with people from elsewhere. Preferences for cultural sameness are often about seemingly small matters&#x2014;say, the pea soup that Swedes traditionally eat on Thursday or a national taciturnity so extreme that, in Sweden, according to Daun, "signaling in traffic is often considered an undesirable expression of aggression." If you are among those Swedes who feel a warm glow when eating pea soup on Thursday or a slight unease when signaling on turns, then immigration can make your life a little bit crummier, because it disrupts those patterns. And this is so even if the immigrants are perfectly upstanding citizens from a neighboring country.<br><br>But immigration from neighboring countries does not provoke the most worrisome immigration questions, such as "How well will they fit in?" "Is assimilation what they want?" and, most of all, "Where are their true loyalties?"&#x2014;culminating in a troubled "Where is this all heading?" Describing intra-European movements as "immigration" can be a useful debating trick for those who wish to short-circuit discussion of the problems of <i>non</i>-European immigration. ("Why are Moroccan slums in Amsterdam a problem, but not German retirement communities in Ibiza?") In this sense, using the word <i>immigration</i> to describe intra-European movements makes only slightly more sense than describing a New Yorker as an "immigrant" to California. Movement between European countries does count as immigration for statistical purposes. But it is not what this book is about.<br><b>Muslim immigration</b><br><br>This book concerns a second type of immigration: immigration from non-European countries and cultures. To be more precise, it is about certain problems created by the desire of non-Europeans to settle in Europe for good: the problems of multiethnic and multicultural societies. There have always been Western European countries that contain multiple European peoples with distinct linguistic and cultural identities&#x2014;Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Spain, and Switzerland in particular. Intercontinental immigration on the present scale, however, is unheard of. And it is unpopular. In no country in Europe does the bulk of the population aspire to live in a bazaar of world cultures. Yet all European countries are coming to the wrenching realization that they have somehow, without anyone's actively choosing it, turned into such bazaars.<br><br>In theory, any profoundly different culture ...</p><h2>Arts &amp; Crafts Design</h2><p><p>Originally published in 1916 when the Arts &amp; Crafts movement was in its heyday, this is a virtual textbook of materials, color, techniques, and designs.

Her interest in the Scottish clan system began in the most unlikely of places: a comparative legal history course at Stanford Law School. After a short but enjoyable stint practicing law, she realized that her legal vocation and her husband&#x2019;s transitory career as a professional baseball player were not exactly a match made in heaven.

Rarely did she give in to an impulse or flight of fancy. If the apple had been Eve&#x2019;s downfall then &#x201c;that little voice&#x201d; in the back of her head barraging her with &#x201c;good ideas&#x201d; had been Jeannie&#x2019;s.

The pull of an unusually hot day so close to Samhain, and the knowledge of how refreshing it would feel to swim in the cool waters of the loch before the sun gave way to the gray of winter proved too tempting.

She was almost out the door when a voice behind her halted her in her tracks. &#x201c;Going somewhere, Daughter?&#x201d;<br><br>The sharp voice of her mother-in-law, teeming with censure, set her teeth on edge. If mourning the death of her husband wasn&#x2019;t enough, Jeannie had been forced to contend with the oppressive presence of his mother, the formidable Marchioness of Huntly, for the past few months as well.<br><br>She clamped her lips together, biting back the ready retort that it was none of her blasted business. Taking a deep breath she turned around and even managed a smile&#x2014;albeit one that stuck to her teeth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so lovely outside today I thought I&#x2019;d go for a quick swim in the loch. I&#x2019;m taking a guardsman with me,&#x201d; she offered, anticipating the objection.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t know why she was explaining herself. Nothing Jeannie did ever met with the Marchioness&#x2019;s approval. Jeannie had never been worthy of her son when he was alive, and now that he was dead could never hope to be. Why Jeannie still bothered trying to please her, she didn&#x2019;t know. But she did. To do otherwise was to admit one more failure to her husband and that she could not contemplate.<br><br>The Marchioness returned a smile that was every bit as forced as her own. Her mother-in-law might have been an attractive woman at one time, but over the years the sourness of her temperament turned outward, taking a toll on her countenance. Sharp lines of disapproval were mapped across her face, and the corners of her mouth turned down in a perpetual frown. Tall and frail&#x2014;from the constant fasting she did to prove her discipline as well as her devotion&#x2014;she looked like a strip of salted herring left to dry in the sun.<br><br>Jeannie had always hated herring.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure that is wise?&#x201d; It was criticism masked as a question&#x2014;a particular skill of the Marchioness&#x2019;s. The woman seemed to take distinct pleasure in questioning&#x2014;and by implication, criticizing&#x2014;everything Jeannie did. It was ridiculous. Jeannie was nearly eight and twenty, but standing before the older woman she felt like a recalcitrant bairn. The Marchioness shook her head and tisked in a poor attempt at motherly fondness. &#x201c;You know what happened last time you went off by yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeannie clenched her fists at her side, resenting the implication that the recent abduction attempt was in any way her fault. Though they&#x2019;d been beset by cattle reiving since Francis&#x2019;s death&#x2014;a widow being perceived as an easy target&#x2014;bride abduction hardly followed. How could Jeannie have foreseen that her regular morning ride would be seen as an opportunity to claim her wealth and lands by such a barbaric practice? &#x201c;I have my pistol and, as I said before, Tavish will be with me. Another score of guardsmen are well within shouting distance. The loch is barely beyond the castle gate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A woman alone is always a temptation. You need more protection than a simple guardsman can provide.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeannie knew where this was heading and she would not allow the Marchioness to browbeat her into remarriage to a man of her choosing. Jeannie hadn&#x2019;t had a choice in her first marriage&#x2014;it was either that or disgrace&#x2014;but she had no intention of marrying again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, you know best, dear,&#x201d; her mother-in-law said chirpily, but Jeannie wasn&#x2019;t fooled. &#x201c;Francis did always say that once you put your mind to something it was like trying to stop a charging boar.&#x201d;<br><br>But Francis had said it with love and affection, not with condemnation. For a moment Jeannie wavered. Then she realized how ridiculous this was. She&#x2019;d worked hard to atone for her past mistakes, and she&#x2019;d be damned if she would be made to pay for them forever. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a swim.&#x201d; She almost added &#x201c;for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; but knew the satisfaction of the blasphemy would be dulled by the week of reparation that would follow to her intensely devout mother-in-law.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; the Marchioness said, quite put upon. &#x201c;I was only thinking of your welfare.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeannie repressed a groan. Guilt was another particular skill of hers. &#x201c;I appreciate your concern, but there is nothing to worry about. I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br><br>And before she could change her mind, Jeannie stepped through the door and out into the sunshine. She trotted down the stairs and crossed the yard to where Tavish waited. As they made they made their way across the forested glen to the loch, Jeannie tried to put her mother-in-law out of her mind. The Marchioness might have put a damper on the spontaneity of her outing, but Jeannie had every intention of enjoying herself.<br><br>A short while later she had her wish. From the first moment she&#x2019;d jumped from the rock perched a few feet above the loch into the shock of icy water she&#x2019;d felt reinvigorated. Freed from the grief and guilt she&#x2019;d been mired in since her husband&#x2019;s death. Now, with the warm afternoon sun beating down upon her face, floating aimlessly atop the pool of blue-green, she felt relaxed. The gentle sway of the undulating water lulled her into a state of peace that she&#x2019;d not felt in a long time.<br><br>She paddled around on her back a little longer, though the hour she&#x2019;d initially allotted had come and gone. A soft wind swept over her, the wet skin of her exposed chest prickling with gooseflesh. Suddenly, the warmth on her face vanished, replaced by a dark shadow. Opening her eyes, she gazed up into the sky to see the clear blue stretch of sky marred by a thick roll of clouds.<br><br>A sign, it seemed, that her moment of peace was gone.<br><br>She rolled over and plunged through the water one more time, diving deep and swimming the twenty or so feet to the edge of the loch before bursting through the glassy surface in an explosion of water and light.<br><br>Trudging through the hip-deep water up to the shore with the goopy silt of the loch floor squishing between her toes, the hint of a smile curved the corners of her mouth. She felt lighter. Happier. Almost refreshed. For the first time since Francis had died, Jeannie felt as if she could breathe. The horrible smothering tightness in her chest finally had loosened its virulent grip.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been right to come. For once an impulse had not led her astray.<br><br>Emerging from the water, she wrapped her arms around her chest in a futile attempt to ward off the blast of frigid air. Teeth-chattering, she gazed down and blushed. Every inch of her body was very clearly revealed in the sodden ivory linen plastered to her damp skin. She glanced around, hoping that Tavish had kept his promise to watch over her from afar. If not, he was certainly getting an eyeful. In her current state, as her old nursemaid used to say, very little was left to the imagination. But it was remarkably still . . . and quiet. Almost unnaturally so.<br><br>A whisper of disquiet swept across the back of her neck.<br><br>No. She pushed it aside. The Marchioness&#x2019;s doom and gloom would not spoil this day.<br><br>She ran the last few steps to her belongings and snatched a drying cloth from the top of the pile to wrap around herself. Going right to work, she rubbed the swath of linen over her face and limbs, removing as much of the water as she could from her skin before using the cloth to squeeze some of the excess from her hair. But the long, thick waves would take hours to dry even sitting before a fire.<br><br>Cursing her strange apprehension, which she fully attributed to her mother-in-law&#x2019;s interference, she glanced around one more time to make sure she was alone, then yanked her wet sark over her head, letting it drop at her feet, before reaching for a fresh one.<br><br>Bent over, naked as the day she was born, Jeannie heard a sound behind her. A sound that turned her blood to ice and made every hair at the back of her neck stand up in fear.<br><br>The guardsman never saw it coming.<br><br>Engrossed in ogling the woman swimming in the loch, he crumpled at Duncan&#x2019;s feet like a poppet of rags. Out cold, blood trickled from the gash at his temple.<br><br>Duncan could almost feel sorry for him. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time this woman had been the cause of a man&#x2019;s fall from grace.<br><br>Not that it was any excuse for such an egregious failure in his duty. If he were one of Duncan&#x2019;s men, there would be severe consequences beyond a knock on the pate for the lapse. His men were revered for their discipline and control, as much as they were feared for their dominance on the battlefield.<br><br>Bending over the prone man, Duncan quickly divested the fallen warrior of his weapons, and then returned his own dirk to the gold scabbard at his waist. The blow from the heavy, jewel-encrusted hilt wouldn&#x2019;t do any lasting damage, but the pain in the man&#x2019;s head when he woke would give him something to think about. But that wouldn&#x2019;t be any time soon, buying Duncan time enough to complete his unpleasant task.<br><br>This was a meeting better had alone&#x2014;and without interruption.</p><h2>Isabella of Castile: Europe&#39;s First Great Queen</h2><p><p><b>A major biography of the queen who transformed Spain into a principal global power, and sponsored the voyage that would open the New World.</b></p><p>In 1474, when Castile was the largest, strongest, and most populous kingdom in Hispania (present day Spain and Portugal), a twenty-three-year-old woman named Isabella ascended the throne. At a time when successful queens regnant were few and far between, Isabella faced not only the considerable challenge of being a young, female ruler in an overwhelmingly male-dominated world, but also of reforming a major European kingdom riddled with crime, debt, corruption, and religious factionism. Her marriage to Ferdinand of Aragon united two kingdoms, a royal partnership in which Isabella more than held her own. Their pivotal reign was long and transformative, uniting Spain and setting the stage for its golden era of global dominance. </p><p>Acclaimed historian Giles Tremlett chronicles the life of Isabella of Castile as she led her country out of the murky Middle Ages and harnessed the newest ideas and tools of the early Renaissance to turn her ill-disciplined, quarrelsome nation into a sharper, truly modern state with a powerful, clear-minded, and ambitious monarch at its center. With authority and insight he relates the story of this legendary, if controversial, first initiate in a small club of great European queens that includes Elizabeth I of England, Russia's Catherine the Great, and Britain's Queen Victoria.</p></p><p><b>Giles Tremlett </b>is the Madrid correspondent for the <i>Economist</i>.

Haas lives in Dallas, Texas, with his wife and six dogs.On the heels of his African Critters (2008), Haas, a veteran wildlife photographer, proffers another set of photos from several of his albums for adults. Here he accompanies the pictures&#x2014;which range from shots of a herd of wildebeests harassed by lions to Alaskan bears in a salmon stream, humpback whales cavorting in waters off Greenland, and a stork mincing oh-so-carefully past a group of watching caimans in Brazil&#x2014;with anecdotal commentary on the hazards and pleasures of viewing nature from an aerial perspective. Highlights include one gory shot of a crocodile chowing down on an unidentifiable haunch and Haas&#x2019; renowned picture (which he swears is not Photoshopped) of a bird-shaped flock of flamingos. Though many of the animals on view are not identified in either captions or the index, this does provide young viewers with an unusual perspective on the natural world.

Born in the midst of the Wars of the Roses, Margaret Beaufort became the greatest heiress of her time. She survived a turbulent life, marrying four times and enduring imprisonment before passing her claim to the crown of England to her son, Henry VII, the first of the Tudor monarchs. Margaret&#39;s royal blood placed her on the fringes of the Lancastrian royal dynasty. After divorcing her first husband at the age of ten, she married the king&#39;s half-brother, Edmund Tudor, becoming a widow and bearing her only child, the future Henry VII, before her fourteenth birthday. Margaret was always passionately devoted to the interests of her son who claimed the throne through her. She embroiled herself in both treason and conspiracy as she sought to promote his claims, allying herself with the Yorkist Queen, Elizabeth Woodville, in an attempt to depose Richard III. She was imprisoned by Richard and her lands confiscated, but she continued to work on her son&#39;s behalf, ultimately persuading her fourth husband, the powerful Lord Stanley, to abandon the king in favour of Henry on the eve of the decisive Battle of Bosworth. It was Lord Stanley himself who placed the crown on Henry&#39;s head on the battlefield. Henry VII gave his mother unparalleled prominence during his reign. She established herself as an independent woman and ended her life as regent of England, ruling on behalf of her seventeen-year-old grandson, Henry VIII.</p><p>Elizabeth Norton gained her first degree from the University of Cambridge, and her Masters from the University of Oxford.

It was in the middle of</p><p>the night in the deepest summer, and thus it never darkened</p><p>to black until it was nearly dawn again. He was sleeping</p><p>deeply in that soft gray dark of the midnight summer when</p><p>the dream came. He stood on a high, narrow cliff listening,</p><p>sniffing the warm, wet air. Below him was a raging waterfall</p><p>roiling through slick boulders only to narrow with the</p><p>tightening of the banks before it shot out over a lower cliff,</p><p>crashing far below beyond where he could see. A light mist</p><p>fell about him. It was suddenly so cold that he shivered.</p><p>He pulled his warm woolen cloak closer.</p><p>All around him were thick stands of trees and bright</p><p>purple and yellow flowering plants that seemed to grow out</p><p>of the rocks themselves. Boulders and large stones were</p><p>scattered among the low, scrubby brush. He followed the</p><p>snaking path, making his way down through the narrow cut</p><p>in the foliage. A pony awaited him at the bottom: black as</p><p>night with a white star on its forehead. It was blowing gently.</p><p>Cleve knew the pony. Although it was small, it seemed</p><p>right to him. He realized that just as he knew the pony, he</p><p>knew this land of crags and misting rain and air so soft and</p><p>sweet it made him want to weep.</p><p>There was a single wolfskin on his pony&#x2019;s back which he</p><p>knocked askew when he jumped onto its back. A moment</p><p>later, he was racing across a meadow that was filled with</p><p>bright flowers, their sweet scent filling the air. The misting</p><p>rain stopped and the sun came out. It was high overhead,</p><p>hot and bright. Soon he felt sweat bead on his forehead. The</p><p>pony turned at the end of the meadow toward another trail</p><p>that led eastward. He pulled the pony to a stop, turning it</p><p>away to the opposite direction. He felt sweat stinging his</p><p>eyes, wet his armpits. No, he didn&#x2019;t want to go that way,</p><p>just thinking of it made his belly cramp with fear. No, he</p><p>wanted to ride away, far away, never to have to see . . . see</p><p>what? He sat atop the pony&#x2019;s back shaking his head back</p><p>and forth. No, never would he go back. But then he knew</p><p>he would, knew he had no choice, and suddenly, he was</p><p>there, staring blankly at the huge wooden house with its sod</p><p>and shingled roof. This was no simple home really, but a</p><p>fortress. He realized then that he heard nothing, absolutely</p><p>nothing. There was so much silence, yet men and women</p><p>were working in the fields, carrying firewood, directing</p><p>children. A man with huge arms was lifting a sword above</p><p>his head, testing its weight and balance. There was no</p><p>laughter, no arguments, just a deathly silence that filled the</p><p>air itself and he knew that was the way it always was. Then</p><p>he heard low voices coming from within the huge fortress.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t want to go in there. The voices became louder as</p><p>the immense wooden door opened. Through air that was</p><p>thick with smoke from the fire pit he could see men sharpening</p><p>their axes, polishing their helmets. He could see</p><p>women weaving, sewing, and cooking. It all looked so normal,</p><p>yet he wanted to run from this place, but he couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Then he saw her standing there, her golden head bowed, so</p><p>small she was, so defenseless, and he backed away, shaking</p><p>his head, feeling a keening wail build up inside him. She&#x2019;d</p><p>spun, dyed, and woven his woolen cloak for him and he</p><p>clutched it to him as if by doing so he could clutch her and</p><p>save her. A part of him seemed to know the danger she was</p><p>in; he also knew he was helpless to prevent what would</p><p>happen. He was outside the fortress now, but he could still</p><p>hear the calm, low voice that was speaking from somewhere</p><p>within. It was deadly, that voice, just as deadly as the</p><p>man who possessed it. Soon he would be silent. Soon, all</p><p>would be silent, except for her. The low, deep voice murmured</p><p>on until it was pierced by the woman&#x2019;s scream. That</p><p>was all it took; Cleve knew what had happened.</p><p>He ran as fast as he could, looking frantically for the</p><p>pony, but the pony was no longer there. He heard a cry of</p><p>pain, then another and another. The cries grew louder and</p><p>louder, filling him with such unutterable emptiness that he</p><p>saw nothing, became nothing.</p><p>He gasped, jerking upright in his box bed.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Papa.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>He heard her soft voice before he could react, before he</p><p>could pull himself away from the terror he couldn&#x2019;t see, a</p><p>terror that gnawed at him just the same. He knew, he</p><p>knew . . .</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Papa. I heard you cry out. Are you all right?&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Aye,&#x2019;&#x2019; he said finally, focusing on his daughter. Her</p><p>hair, as golden as his own, fell in tangles around her small</p><p>face. &#x2018;&#x2018; &#x2019;Twas a vicious dream, naught more, just a dream.</p><p>Come here, sweeting, and let me hug you.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>He tried to believe it was just a dream, nothing more</p><p>than a simple dream concocted out of the barley soup he&#x2019;d</p><p>eaten for the evening meal.</p><p>He lifted his daughter onto the box bed and pulled her</p><p>into his arms. He held her close to his heart, this small</p><p>perfect being whom he&#x2019;d magically created. He tried not to</p><p>think of her mother, Sarla, the woman he&#x2019;d loved who had</p><p>tried to kill him, particularly not so soon after that dream</p><p>that still made his heart thud against his chest and made</p><p>the sweat itch in his armpits.</p><p>Kiri kissed his chin, curling her thin arms around his</p><p>neck. She squeezed hard, then giggled, and that brought</p><p>him fully back into himself. It had been nothing but a</p><p>strange dream, nothing more.</p><p>She said, &#x2018;&#x2018;I kicked Harald today. He said I couldn&#x2019;t use</p><p>his sword. He said I was a girl and had enough to do without</p><p>learning to kill men. I told him he wasn&#x2019;t a man, he</p><p>was just a little boy. He got all red in the face and called</p><p>me a name I know is bad, so I kicked him hard.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Do you remember what Harald called you?&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>She shook her head against his chest. He smiled down</p><p>at her though he felt more heartache than he wished to let</p><p>on. He couldn&#x2019;t protect her forever from the truth. Children</p><p>heard the adults talking. Sometimes they spoke of that time</p><p>so long ago and spoke of Sarla, then looked sideways at</p><p>Kiri, who looked nothing like her mother. No, Kiri was the</p><p>image of him. Were they trying to see Sarla in her? Aye,</p><p>of course they were.</p><p>He hugged Kiri to him. He loved her so much he ached</p><p>with it. This tiny scrap of his, so perfectly formed, a face</p><p>so beautiful he knew someday men would lose their heads</p><p>at the mere sight of her. Yet from her earliest months Kiri</p><p>had clutched at her father&#x2019;s knife, not at the soft linenstuffed</p><p>doll her Aunt Laren had made for her. It was he</p><p>who arranged the stuffed doll where Kiri slept so Laren&#x2019;s</p><p>feelings wouldn&#x2019;t be hurt.</p><p>To his now sleeping daughter he whispered, &#x2018;&#x2018;I dreamed</p><p>of a place that seems not so different from Norway, but</p><p>deep down I know it is. There was mist so soft you could</p><p>believe it woven into cloth, all gray and light, and yellow</p><p>and purple flowers that were everywhere and I knew they</p><p>were everywhere, not just that place in my dream. It was</p><p>very different from any place I have ever been in my life.</p><p>It was familiar to me. I recognized it. I knew more fear</p><p>than I have in my life.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>He stopped. He didn&#x2019;t want to speak aloud of it. It scared</p><p>him, he freely admitted it to himself. He hadn&#x2019;t been himself</p><p>in that dream, but he had, and that, he couldn&#x2019;t explain.</p><p>He kissed his daughter&#x2019;s hair, then settled her against him.</p><p>He fell asleep near dawn, the lush scent of those strange</p><p>flowers hovering nearby, teasing the air in his small chamber.</p><p>Malverne farmstead</p><p>Vestfold, Norway</p><p>Nearly two years later</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Damnation, Cleve, I could have killed you. You&#x2019;re just</p><p>standing there like a goat without a single thought in his</p><p>head, ready to take an arrow through his heart and be the</p><p>evening meal. What is wrong with you? Where the hell is</p><p>your knife? It should be aimed at my chest, you damned</p><p>madman.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>Cleve shook his head at Merrik Haraldsson, the man who</p><p>had rescued him along with Laren and her small brother,</p><p>Taby, five years before in Kiev. Merrik was his best friend,</p><p>the man who&#x2019;d taught him to fight, to be a Viking warrior,</p><p>the man who was now striding toward him, his bow at his</p><p>side, anger radiating from him because he feared Cleve had</p><p>not learned his lessons well enough. It was an uncertain</p><p>world. Danger could appear at any moment, even here at</p><p>Malverne, Merrik&#x2019;s farmstead, a magnificent home surrounded</p><p>with mighty mountains and a fjord below that was</p><p>so blue it hurt the eyes when the sun shone directly upon</p><p>it.</p><p>Cleve waited. When Merrik was just an arm&#x2019;s length</p><p>from him, Cleve turned smoothly to his side, gracefully</p><p>kicked out his foot, connecting with Merrik&#x2019;s belly, no</p><p>lower, for he didn&#x2019;t want to send his friend into agony, then</p><p>he leapt at him, his knee in his chest, knocking him backward.</p><p>He landed on top of Merrik, straddling him, his knife</p><p>poised at his throat.</p><p>Merrik looked surprised. He said nothing. He brought his</p><p>knees against Cleve&#x2019;s back, hard, knocking the breath from</p><p>him, even as he jerked sideways, hitting upward with his</p><p>mighty arm, trying to throw Cleve to the ground beyond</p><p>him. Cleve dug his knees into Merrik&#x2019;s lean sides, closed</p><p>his eyes against the pain in his back, and held on. Were</p><p>Merrik an enemy, he would be dead, the knife sliding clean</p><p>and quickly through his neck, but this was naught but sport</p><p>and there was more pain to be borne, more grunts and</p><p>curses to turn the air a richer blue than it now was in late</p><p>spring, more breaths to explode into the warm afternoon</p><p>light, before Merrik would allow him to declare victory, if</p><p>that would indeed be the outcome. Merrik was a cunning</p><p>bastard and Cleve still hadn&#x2019;t learned all his tricks, even</p><p>after five long years.</p><p>Oleg shouted from behind them, &#x2018;&#x2018;Enough, both of you.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll kill each other and then what will Laren do? I&#x2019;ll tell</p><p>you what. She&#x2019;d take Merrik&#x2019;s big sword and hit both your</p><p>butts with the broad side. Then she&#x2019;d kiss Merrik until he</p><p>wanted to rut more than he wanted to fight.&#x2019;&#x2019; He was laughing,</p><p>standing over them now, hands on his hips. Oleg was</p><p>a big man, golden as most of the Vikings were, his eyes as</p><p>blue as the summer sky.</p><p>Finally, when Cleve lightened the pressure from Merrik&#x2019;s</p><p>throat, Merrik splayed his hands upward in the dirt. &#x2018;&#x2018;I am</p><p>defeated. Actually, I&#x2019;m dead, truth be told. You and that</p><p>bloody knife, Cleve. You&#x2019;ve gotten much too adroit with</p><p>it. Then you&#x2019;ve got the gall to toss it away and use your</p><p>elbows on me, a trick I taught you.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;You were angry, Merrik. You&#x2019;ve told me often enough</p><p>that a man is a fool if he allows himself to be angered</p><p>during a fight.&#x2019;&#x2019; Cleve grinned down at him. &#x2018;&#x2018;Actually, I</p><p>don&#x2019;t think you had a chance, angry or not.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>Merrik cursed him, loud and long, until all three of them</p><p>were laughing and others had come to them and were telling</p><p>some of their own tales of cunning and guile.</p><p>Cleve climbed off Merrik, then offered his hand to his</p><p>friend. Merrik could have broken Cleve&#x2019;s arm, could have</p><p>thrown him six feet with a simple twist of his body, could</p><p>have brought him eye to eye and crushed the life from him,</p><p>but he&#x2019;d claimed defeat, and thus the sport was done, at</p><p>least for now. There was always another day to test each</p><p>other&#x2019;s strength.</p><p>Suddenly, Merrik was as serious as he&#x2019;d been when fever</p><p>had come to Malverne the past spring and killed ten of their</p><p>people. &#x2018;&#x2018;Listen to me, Cleve. You can never relax vigilance,</p><p>you know that. There is always trouble somewhere,</p><p>and if you blink, the trouble can be right in front of you.</p><p>Remember just weeks ago my cousin Lotti nearly died</p><p>when a wild boar came into the barley fields? She was</p><p>lucky that Egill was nearby. You can never nap, my friend,</p><p>never.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>Cleve remembered well enough and the memory still</p><p>made his blood run cold. Cleve adored Lotti, a woman who</p><p>couldn&#x2019;t speak but who could communicate just as clearly</p><p>as those who did by moving her fingers. It was a language</p><p>of her own creation but all the Malek people, her children,</p><p>and her husband, Egill, understood, and spoke thus to her</p><p>as well. Cleve himself had learned some words over the</p><p>past five years but he doubted his fingers could ever be so</p><p>adroit as Lotti&#x2019;s or Egill&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;I was thinking of a dream I had,&#x2019;&#x2019; Cleve said. No</p><p>sooner had he said this than he wished he&#x2019;d kept his</p><p>mouth shut. Dreams were always important to Vikings,</p><p>each one remembered was spoken about, argued over</p><p>endlessly, until all were satisfied that it posed no danger</p><p>to any of them.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;What dream?&#x2019;&#x2019; Oleg said, handing each man a cup of</p><p>pure fjord water, so cold in late spring that it constricted</p><p>the throat.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;A dream that has come to me five times now.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Five nights in a row?&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Nay, Oleg, five times over the past two years, it has</p><p>come unexpected. It has become fuller, richer, I suppose,</p><p>like one of Ileria&#x2019;s tapestries, yet I still can&#x2019;t grasp what it</p><p>means. But it means something, I know that it does. It&#x2019;s</p><p>very frustrating.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Tell us,&#x2019;&#x2019; Merrik said. &#x2018;&#x2018;A dream that returns in fuller</p><p>detail could mean something very important, Cleve. It</p><p>could portend things to come, mayhap dangers of which we</p><p>know naught as of yet.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p> &#x2018;&#x2018;I cannot, Merrik. Not yet. Please, my friend, not yet.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not about here or about you. It&#x2019;s about the past, the</p><p>very distant past.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>Merrik let it go. Cleve was as stubborn as Laren, Merrik&#x2019;s</p><p>red-haired wife, particularly once he&#x2019;d made up his</p><p>mind. As they walked down to the fjord to swim with a</p><p>half dozen of the men and boys, he changed the subject.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;You leave tomorrow for Normandy and Rollo&#x2019;s court.</p><p>You will tell Duke Rollo we will come to Rouen to visit</p><p>after harvest.&#x2019;&#x2019; He paused a moment, his face lighting with</p><p>such affection that Cleve was glad Merrik&#x2019;s sons weren&#x2019;t</p><p>there to see it. &#x2018;&#x2018;Tell Taby I will teach him a new wrestling</p><p>trick. By all the gods, I miss him. He&#x2019;s ten years old now,</p><p>a handsome lad, honest and loyal.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;You couldn&#x2019;t have kept him with you, Merrik. As</p><p>Rollo&#x2019;s nephew, he belongs in Normandy.&#x2019;&#x2019; Aye, he</p><p>thought, Rollo had subjugated northern France so that the</p><p>French king had been forced to grant him the ti...</p></p><h2>I Live in the Slums: Stories (The Margellos World Republic of Letters)</h2><p>In Can Xue&#x2019;s world the superficial is peeled away to reveal layers of depth and meaning.

He tried to swallow, but the desert at high noon couldn't be as dry as his mouth.<br><br><em>What the hell was going on?</em><br><br>Disoriented, in agony, Jackson Savor got one eye open.<br><br>The source of his sharpest pain was a blinding ray of Kentucky's morning sunshine slicing through the part in his bedroom curtains.<br><br>His curtains. So he was in his own apartment.<br><br>With one question answered, he closed his eye again and struggled to take inventory.<br><br>Had he been captured? Tortured?<br><br>Slowly, very slowly, he moved his right hand. His arm felt like lead, but he lifted it.<br><br>Sluggish, a little weak, but not bound, thank God.<br><br>He tried to move his left hand and realized that something warm and soft kept him pinned in place. He inhaled...and recognized the enticing, undeniable scent of woman.<br><br>Oh, shit.<br><br>Staying very still to avoid alerting anyone to his cognizance, Jackson opened his hand and.felt.<br><br>He didn't need a clear head or his vision to know he palmed a very sweet female backside.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>The body beside him stirred. A slim, smooth leg came over his, gliding up and over his crotch. Inside he jolted, but outside he stayed perfectly still.<br><br>A woman purred, "You're awake?"<br><br>Both eyes shot open with recognition. He snapped his head around so fast that pain nearly blinded him.<br><br>The knee resting over his dick shifted as the woman readjusted to better see him. "Is something wrong?"<br><br>Shit, shit, <em>shit. </em>Carefully, his eyelids scraping like sandpaper, Jackson peered to his side and found none other than Alani Rivers. Sleepy, warm, soft. She watched him with sated, golden brown eyes, her pale hair spread out around her&#x2014;on <em>his </em>pillows.<br><br>She had the unmistakable look of a woman who'd spent a satisfying night doing the nasty.<br><br><em>With him?</em><br><br>Though no words came from his parched throat, the hand on her ass contracted. Yeah, so his brain wasn't quite working&#x2014;his instincts were fine and dandy.<br><br>Blushing, Alani ducked her face and rose up to an elbow.<br><br>The sheet pulled to her waist, giving him an up close and personal view of her <em>really </em>beautiful breasts and rosy nipples.<br><br>His thoughts cramped. So did his balls.<br><br>"So quiet this morning," she murmured as she bent and kissed his mouth. "Especially after last night."<br><br>Meaning... what? Had they been noisy? Had he been chatty?<br><br>She chewed her bottom lip. "Are you feeling as shy as I am about the things we did?"<br><br>Shy? Never. <em>What the hell had they done ? </em>He tried to sort it out, but beyond the pain and the confusion was the mind-boggling fact that he had Alani Rivers in his bed.<br><br>Naked.<br><br>Affectionate.<br><br>Replete.<br><br>And he didn't know how any of it had happened.<br><br>Acid crawled around his guts and squirreled up his throat, making his stomach pitch. Groaning, he threw back the covers.<br><br>Didn't matter if his head fell off, he would <em>not </em>puke in front of her.<br><br>In only a few long strides, he made it to the connecting bathroom where he dropped to his knees in front of the john in just the nick of time.<br><br>He felt vile. Worse than that even.<br><br><em>What the hell had happened?</em><br><br>"Jackson?"<br><br>He looked up to see Alani in the doorway. Naked. He groaned again. "Go away."<br><br>"But.can I get you&#x2014;"<br><br>"Out!" He kicked at the door. It hit so hard that it bounced open again. He saw her shock and hurt, but damn it, no way in hell did he want her to see him like this.<br><br>Luckily for them both, she turned and strode away.<br><br>When the nausea finally subsided, he flushed the toilet and, feeling weaker than a newborn, used the edge of the sink to haul himself to his feet. His legs shook. His head thundered.<br><br>He turned on cold water, splashed his face, rinsed his mouth, and after a few seconds of mental searching that left him blank, he turned to stagger out.<br><br>Alani stood there yet again.<br><br>Still naked.<br><br>Jackson swayed. He tried, but he couldn't take it in. For a hell of a long time, he'd wanted her. Now she was here, but...how? Why?<br><br>His burning gaze zeroed in on her neat triangle of golden brown pubic hair. Another question answered&#x2014; but it had nada to do with his current predicament.<br><br>She folded her arms under her breasts, which had the effect of getting his riveted attention off her lower body and up a little&#x2014;as far as her chest anyway.<br><br><em>Ah, damn, so pretty. </em>Had he touched her breasts? Kissed her nipples?<br><br>Dizziness assailed him. The possibility of passing out or puking more loomed near.<br><br>But God Almighty, she looked fine. Better than fine.<br><br>She looked like <em>his.</em><br><br>Face red, voice high, she snapped, "Real nice, Jackson."<br><br>Picking up on the acrimony, he managed to meet her gaze through a fog of emotions. Uh-oh. She looked both hurt and pissed.<br><br>Her lips tightened. She gave one fleeting glance at his body, but when he remained mute, her eyes narrowed and she tossed her head, sending back her long fair hair. Like pale liquid, it poured over her smooth skin, mostly behind her shoulders, though one long strand trailed over her breast.<br><br>Mesmerized, he took a moment to realize she was talking to him.<br><br>"I <em>told </em>you this wasn't a good idea," she said. "I told you it would never work."<br><br>Looked to him like it had worked just fine.<br><br>But to make sure they were on the same page, he rasped, "It?" Bracing one hand on the door frame, the other squeezing the bridge of his nose, he started on a great admission. "Thing is, I don't remember&#x2014;"<br><br>"Talking about it?"<br><br><em>Anything. </em>"Uh."<br><br>"Big surprise there, right?" Her attention tracked down over him, then jumped back to his face. "You were too busy getting me naked to listen to reason."<br><br>Sounded like him, he had to admit.<br><br>"Too busy racing for the bed," she complained, "to even think about my concerns, about what I said."<br><br>The words resonated over and over. <em>He'd gotten her naked and in bed.</em><br><br>And then what?<br><br>Nothing rational came to his spinning brain, so Jackson just shook his head while again looking at her body. If it wasn't for the door frame supporting him, he'd be on his face on the floor, but he couldn't <em>not </em>look at her.<br><br>Wounded, disgusted, Alani turned on her heel and stalked back to his bed. Seeing the bounce of her rounded backside gave him a whole new reason to wish his vision wasn't so blurry.<br><br>"Alani..." With no idea what to say, Jackson started to follow her. One jarring step was enough to warn him not to leave the dubious convenience of the bathroom.<br><br>His stomach did jumping jacks. In the nick of time he dropped back down in front of the toilet again.<br><br>This time when he finished, his stomach muscles ached but his guts felt a little quieter, as if he'd gotten some foul poison out of his system.<br><br>Unfortunately, Alani was now fully dressed and marching toward the front door.<br><br>Feeling like a weak, mewling pup, he stumbled behind her. "Wait."<br><br>Pausing, she looked back at him&#x2014;and all over him.<br><br>It suddenly dawned on Jackson that he was completely naked, too. He held on to the wall and willed away the pulsing agony in his noggin. "Let's.talk."<br><br>"So you can get sick again with...regret? No thank you."<br><br>Regret? There was more to regret beyond the fact that he couldn't remember shitola?<br><br>She jerked his front door open but didn't storm away. With her back to him, her voice quavering, she said, "Don't worry about it, Jackson. I'm naive, I know, but I'm not dumb. I understand what happened."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"I won't say a word to anyone and since this will never happen again, you can just forget all about it."<br><br>The slamming of the door almost took out his knees. Slowly, he sank down to the cool hardwood floor in his hallway. His eyes closed, but he could still see Alani naked.<br><br>He didn't want to forget a damn thing. He wanted to <em>remember.</em><br><br>Alani stayed busy as long as she could. She'd shopped, cleaned her car, had a light breakfast, seen an early matinee...but no amount of distraction had helped. Her chest still hurt with the weight of thick emotion.<br><br>Humiliation vied with regret.<br><br>Why had she believed him?<br><br>Why had she allowed herself to be so easily swayed?<br><br>Fool!<br><br>What could have been the most amazing night of her life now felt like the most degrading. Not that she could blame Jackson for everything. She'd been so infatuated with him for so long, it had required very little from him to win her over. A few small words and.<br><br>The groan vibrated out, heartfelt, sad and angry.<br><br>She'd done things with Jackson that she'd never before considered. He'd encouraged her to speak her mind, to be totally open and honest about what she wanted, what she enjoyed&#x2014;and he'd done the same. With him, she'd reveled in her sexuality.<br><br>And then, with the morning light, he'd taken one look at her and rushed off to be ill.<br><br>Her face flamed.<br><br>All along, from the very first day she'd met Jackson Savor, she'd known he was trouble. Over and over again she'd resisted him because an involvement with any man who worked with her brother, especially a man too much like her brother, seemed impossible.<br><br>Her cell phone rang, and she glanced at the caller ID. Speak of the devil... Her brother had already called several times, but she wasn't up to speaking with him.<br><br>She waited until the ringing stopped, then checked her voice mail. Trace said, "Where are you, Alani? I've called three times now. I want to talk to you. Call me back."<br><br>She knew Trace fully expected her to do as told, but she couldn't talk to him right now. If she tried to, she'd get emotional, maybe even weepy. God knew Trace had always been protective, but since her kidnapping more than a year ago, he'd been insane with caution. If he knew she was upset, he'd be on the warpath in minutes. She had no intention of telling him about her misguided&#x2014;and obviously brief&#x2014;liaison with Jackson, so there'd be no point in getting him caught up in her personal drama.<br><br>By necessity, given the responsibilities inherent in his work, Trace was autocratic by nature, occasionally overbearing and always too confident.<br><br>Jackson was the same.<br><br>Actually, so was Trace's friend, Dare, who had worked with Trace from the inception of the business.<br><br>They had typical personalities for lethally honed mercenaries&#x2014;how else could they remain so successful in their efforts to help others?<br><br>Of course, Trace, Dare and Jackson were the only mercenaries she knew. And while each of them was different, they were also, in the most basic ways, the same.<br><br>They were men who smiled while squaring off with danger, men who didn't flinch when put to the test, men who, without a single second of hesitation, would protect others with their own lives.<br><br>They were good men.<br><br>They were scary men.<br><br>Most people, even without knowing of her brother's vocation, still feared him, and with good reason; Trace emanated danger and capability. To meet him was to be wary of him, and so dating had never been easy for her. Guys took one look at her brother and decided it was safer to keep their distance.<br><br>But... Jackson wasn't like most guys. Because he was on a par with Trace, not much ever intimidated him. In fact, he felt at ease jesting with Trace, even taunting him on occasion with his good humor. Knowing Trace and Dare counted on him in the most dangerous situations, Jackson had promised her that his job security wouldn't be affected by their involvement.<br><br>But then, he'd also sworn that it wouldn't be awkward. Now she was on her own, and it was so excruciatingly awkward that her face continued to burn.<br><br>Unfortunately, Trace called yet again as she parked in the driveway. The phone rang four times and then went to voice mail. Alani just knew Trace would show up on her doorstep if she didn't touch base.<br><br>Hating to fib, but feeling she had no choice, she sent back a text message saying only, "I'm at the movies. I'll call you soon."<br><br>Then she turned off the phone.<br><br>After gathering the clothing bags from her trunk, she started around the walkway that led from the driveway on the side of her small but perfect house to the front door.<br><br>She drew up short at the sight of Jackson sprawled out on her porch steps, a cowboy hat on his head, mirrored sunglasses hiding his eyes.<br><br>He didn't move, and neither did she.<br><br>For half a minute she stood there frozen, unsure what to say, what to do.<br><br>He had an utterly relaxed look about him, but then, Jackson had perfected a deceptively indolent pose that hid razor-sharp reflexes and phenomenal speed.<br><br>Last night, <em>all night, </em>he'd been far from indolent.<br><br>Breathing fast, Alani studied him. His continued stillness suggested sleep. Even when she shifted her bags and inched closer, he didn't move.<br><br>The tall oak in her front yard offered plenty of shade, but Jackson hadn't removed the hat or the sunglasses. He was now clean-shaven. A snowy white T-shirt pulled across his wide chest and shoulders and hung looser around his taut abs.<br><br>Age had worn out his faded jeans in select places, such as at the knees, the hems and where they cupped his sex.<br><br>Even now, so tranquil, he looked.impressive.<br><br>The bombardment of awareness stiffened her knees.<br><br>Memories of touching his body, tasting his hot flesh, sent a tide of sensation through her veins. She remembered wrapping her hand around his erection, how he'd groaned all deep and rough, the insanely sexual things he'd whispered to her as suggestions and encouragement, how he'd covered her hand with his own, showing her how hard to squeeze, how fast to stroke...<br><br>His total lack of inhibition had left her free to be less inhibited.<br><br>She swallowed audibly&#x2014;and stared some more.<br><br>He sat with his long legs loose, one foot braced on a step, the other stretched out, his elbows back, his breathing deep and even.<br><br>Alani licked her lips and started to slowly, silently retreat.<br><br>"Don't make me chase you, darlin'."<br><br>Shock snapped her shoulders back. The big faker!<br><br>He'd been watching her watch him. <em>Ohhhhh. </em>"I thought you were asleep!"<br><br>"And so you figured you could rape me with your pretty eyes? Or will you deny that?"<br><br>If she had a rock close by, she'd throw it at him. Teeth set, Alani asked, "What are you doing here?"<br><br></p><h2>Secret of the Golden Cowrie</h2><p>Connie Lawrence loves secrets, and when Aunt Laura shares one with her, it leads them both to a puzzle connected with a beautiful golden cowrie shell.

Fearless spy for the Confederacy, glittering Washington hostess, legendary beauty and lover, Rose Greenhow risked everything for the cause she valued more than life itself. In this superb portrait, biographer Ann Blackman tells the surprising true story of a unique woman in history. <br><br>&#x201c;I am a Southern woman, born with revolutionary blood in my veins,&#x201d; Rose once declared&#x2013;and that fiery spirit would plunge her into the center of power and the thick of adventure. Born into a slave-holding family, Rose moved to Washington, D.C., as a young woman and soon established herself as one of the capital&#x2019;s most charming and influential socialites, an intimate of John C. Calhoun, James Buchanan, and Dolley Madison. <br><br>She married well, bore eight children and buried five, and, at the height of the Gold Rush, accompanied her husband Robert Greenhow to San Francisco. Widowed after Robert died in a tragic accident, Rose became notorious in Washington for her daring&#x2013;and numerous&#x2013;love affairs.<br><br>But with the outbreak of the Civil War, everything changed. Overnight, Rose Greenhow, fashionable hostess, become Rose Greenhow, intrepid spy. As Blackman reveals, deadly accurate intelligence that Rose supplied to General Pierre G. T. Beauregard written in a fascinating code (the code duplicated in the background on the jacket of this book). Her message to Beauregard turned the tide in the first Battle of Bull Run, and was a brilliant piece of spycraft that eventually led to her arrest by Allan Pinkerton and imprisonment with her young daughter. <br><br>Indomitable, Rose regained her freedom and, as the war reached a crisis, journeyed to Europe to plead the Confederate cause at the royal courts of England and France. <br>Drawing on newly discovered diaries and a rich trove of contemporary accounts, Blackman has fashioned a thrilling, intimate narrative that reads like a novel. Wild Rose is an unforgettable rendering of an astonishing woman, a book that will stand with the finest Civil War biographies.</p><p>Ann Blackman is the author of Seasons of Her Life: A Biography of Madeleine Korbel Albright and co-author of The Spy Next Door, about the traitorous FBI agent Robert Hanssen.

A long, lazy cloud of yellow dust trailed from the wheels and hung in the heavy summer air. The driver, wearing a frayed gray frock, passed one sprawling Union army encampment after another. To soldiers moving supply wagons upriver to reinforce newly dug-in positions, the slender figure seemed but a simple farm girl returning home from a morning of selling sweet cream and buttermilk at the city market.<br><br>She was, in fact, not a country girl at all, but a beautiful, well-bred sixteen-year-old named Bettie Duvall, on a secret mission to Confederate territory. It was Tuesday, July 9, 1861, and the untested troops of North and South were spoiling for their first real fight.<br><br>Heading out of the Federal City through Georgetown, Miss Duvall rode by Camp Banks at Georgetown Heights, headquarters of the First Massachusetts Infantry. Some of the soldiers had left that morning, trudging up the road to Great Falls to relieve another unit that had lost two men, shot by rebels from across the river. The two were among the first casualties of war, and the city was in mourning. The Union troops occupied themselves as best they could. &#x201c;We have received some new pants today, dark blue,&#x201d; one wrote in his diary. &#x201c;Are to have blue jackets, I believe.&#x201d;1 When he was hungry, the soldier sneaked out of camp to look for apples, gooseberries, and currants. He also picked a rose from the garden of a departed secessionist and sent it to his parents. A few soldiers beat the heat by taking a dip in the river. They had been told to be ready to march at a moment&#x2019;s notice.<br><br>All around camp, thin wisps of dark smoke curled up from cooking fires, carrying the smell of burnt sugar to hungry soldiers. Boiled rice with sugar sauce was being prepared for dinner. It was a simple meal, but the men liked the sweet taste, and it was certainly a step up from skillygalee, hard bread soaked in cold water and fried brown in pork fat. &#x201c;I must say that Uncle Sam don&#x2019;t feed his soldiers as he ought,&#x201d; wrote a soldier who signed his letter &#x201c;C.B.L.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hard crackers and salt junk is not the thing for a man to fight on.&#x201d;<br><br>Farther up the road, the cart passed Camp Winfield Scott, headquarters of the Second Michigan Infantry, &#x201c;Richardson&#x2019;s Brigade.&#x201d; It was, in the words of soldier Charles B. Haydon, &#x201c;a beautiful location,&#x201d; that rose &#x201c;almost to the dignity of mountains.&#x201d; There had been some fighting upriver two days before, and the infantrymen were eager for more action. &#x201c;I for one am ready to work &amp; give if need be all I am worth which is very little, til the last secessionist is dead or subdued,&#x201d; Haydon wrote.<br><br>The men&#x2019;s provisions were poor, and theft was a problem. Disease was worse. Measles had broken out, and the sick list lengthened daily. Many were also suffering from severe diarrhea and bloody flux, or dysentery, the result of their insufficient diet. When the surgeon expressed bafflement about how to cure it, some men took to doctoring themselves by drinking the juice of boiled blackberry root. They knew they had to get better quickly, because they had been ordered to pack their knapsacks and expected to move out that night.<br><br>A mile beyond the camp, the cart turned sharply left and rattled onto the loose old boards of Chain Bridge. Union artillerymen at Battery Martin Scott, a new, two-tiered stone-and-turf fortification overlooking the bridge, could see the cart and driver from their outpost with its commanding, panoramic view of the Potomac. Twelve-pounder guns mounted at the end of the bridge could sweep the span, and one hundred feet up the hill, three big forty-two-pounders could rake not just the bridge, but the heights beyond. The Union cannoneers used an old stone mill on the opposite side of the Potomac to get their range. But the cart made its way peacefully across. No one stopped the driver.<br><br>Bettie Duvall continued up the road. She had left the city hours earlier and had not even gone halfway to her uncertain destination.<br><br>Despite regular reports of Confederate soldiers lurking around their camps, Union troops controlled both banks of the river, including the northern edge of Virginia from Alexandria below the capital to encampments all along Arlington Heights and up to Chain Bridge. Colonel William Tecumseh Sherman had command of the three New York regiments and the Second Wisconsin Infantry assigned to protect the far side of the river.<br><br>The weather had been intensely hot, interrupted only by severe afternoon thunderstorms. During those brief, violent downpours, water rushed through the soldiers&#x2019; tents like a river, soaking knapsacks and forcing them to sleep on raised boards. Confederate patrols fired across the river at Union encampments at night, and the Union forces returned fire, reporting some casualties. Everyone was on edge.<br><br>Bettie Duvall drove her cart up a steep hill into the Virginia countryside. The road was narrow and badly cut by wagon wheels, slowing her progress. While most of the Union wagons and artillery were behind her, the young Southerner had to look out for Yankee scouts and pickets.<br><br>Not wanting to travel after nightfall, which would increase the danger, she stopped at Sharon, a plantation on the Georgetown &amp; Leesburg Road just west of the village of Langley. It was owned by the family of her friend Lieutenant Catesby R. Jones. Jones had resigned his post as an officer in the United States Navy and left to join the Confederate navy when Virginia seceded from the Union three months earlier, but the family still lived in the ancestral home. The next morning, Miss Duvall changed into a stylish riding habit, abandoned her humble cart, borrowed a saddle horse, and cantered off in the direction of Lewinsville and Tyson Cross roads, where travelers sometimes stopped in a peach grove to rest.<br><br>The dirt road took her past deserted wooden houses and farms with weathered ox fences and through undulating fields of ripening wheat and Indian corn. She headed for the village of Fairfax Court House, some twenty miles west of Washington and only ten miles north of Manassas Junction, the Confederate headquarters of General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard. The Louisiana native, hero of Fort Sumter, had just arrived at Manassas from Charleston to take command of the Confederate Army of the Potomac.<br><br>Near Vienna, Miss Duvall came upon a Confederate outpost and was ordered to halt. The Confederate soldiers, whose gray jackets had already faded to butternut by the relentless sun and yellow dust, had dug trenches in the road and felled thick trees to slow the Union army&#x2019;s expected advance. At last, she had reached friendly territory.<br><br>Miss Duvall told the pickets she had come to see Brigadier General Milledge Luke Bonham, a South Carolina politician who days before had been ordered to relinquish his command of the army to Beauregard, a professional soldier. Bonham, who remained as the general&#x2019;s top aide, was at Fairfax Court House, about five miles to the south. The soldiers escorted their charge to Bonham&#x2019;s headquarters, where she tied her horse to the bough of a tree. But when the general learned of his visitor, he at first refused to see her, fearing she was yet another lady spy dispatched by the Federals to assess the strength of the Confederate army. Told that the young woman was prepared to take her message to Beauregard herself and also, perhaps more important, that she was &#x201c;very pretty,&#x201d; Bonham relented. &#x201c;I was very much startled,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;at recognizing the face of a beautiful young lady, a brunette, with sparkling black eyes, perfect features, glossy black hair.&#x201d; Bonham, who seven months before had been a congressman from South Carolina, remembered seeing Bettie Duvall in the spectator gallery of the House of Representatives, a frequent gathering spot for Southern ladies.<br><br>When she told him the content of her message and he agreed to forward it to his commander, Miss Duvall reached back, took a tuck comb from a chignon of long, silky hair that had been wound gracefully around her head, and shook loose her locks. Bonham watched spellbound as a tiny bag fell out. It was not larger than a silver dollar and had been carefully stitched out of a torn piece of glossy black silk, the kind used in the finest of mourning clothes. The purse contained a slip of white paper with a combination of numbers and letters written in bold handwriting with black ink: 054 1 7 3. It was code for &#x201c;Beauregard.&#x201d;15 With it was a ten-word message, also in code, with information Beauregard would find critical: &#x201c;McDowell has certainly been ordered to advance on the sixteenth. ROG.&#x201d;<br><br>Bettie Duvall&#x2019;s mission was complete. The Confederates now knew that Brigadier General Irvin McDowell, commander of the Union forces around Washington, would march out to attack them in less than one week.<br><br>The initials ROG belonged to Rose O&#x2019;Neale Greenhow, a ravishing and fearless Southerner and grande dame of Washington society. She operated a Confederate spy ring in the nation&#x2019;s capital, and Bettie Duvall was one of her scouts. An engaging widow with three daughters, including an eight-year-old who carried her mother&#x2019;s name, Rose was the heart and soul of the operation.<br><br>She had a passion for politics and many friends, both Democrats and Republicans. She also had an almost reckless disregard for danger and a fiercely independent streak. She could be manipulative and headstrong at one moment, dripping warm Southern cha-arm the next, each syllable melting slowly from her lips like delicate drops of dew.<br><br>Now in middle age, Rose was a handsome woman who carried herself with an air of elegance. While lines creased the corners of her dark, deep-set eyes and her waist had thickened slightly&#x2014;she had given birth to eight children, five of whom died young&#x2014;Rose radiated sensuality. In late evening, when she let down her luxuriant dark hair, it fell below her waist.<br><br>Rose also exuded a hint of vulnerability that men found irresistible. And unlike most well-bred Southern women in an increasingly partisan capital, she entertained Union and secessionist friends not only at her table&#x2014;but, it was whispered, on late night calls as well. Senator Henry D. Wilson of Massachusetts, an abolitionist Republican, was a frequent visitor. So was Senator Joe Lane of Oregon, a Democrat. Both entertained thoughts of higher office.<br><br>Rose captivated the hearts of even the most proper gentlemen, usually to their regret and sometimes to their dismay. With flattery and the finest of feminine wiles, she cajoled military secrets from Union sympathizers, whose inflated egos blinded them to her clever ways and loosened their tongues. Skilled at the art of gathering information from normally tight-lipped officials, she entertained statesmen and diplomats and charmed their lesser-ranked clerks and aides as well. Some may have had unimpressive titles, but their access to paperwork, including military maps, made them vital contacts.<br><br>But as with many players on the Washington stage, Rose&#x2019;s graceful manner and keen sense of style masked a nagging secret. Since the accidental death seven years before of her husband, Robert Greenhow, who had been a high-ranking official at the State Department, she had no regular source of income and was later forced to rely on a son-in-law for financial support. That&#x2019;s never easy, especially for a proud woman like Rose Greenhow, but over the years it forced her to be resourceful. She had become a skilled seamstress and could make the fine black silk dresses with a decorative thread of white lace down the arm that she wore for years as a sign of mourning. She would have had no trouble stitching the small black purse Bettie Duvall had concealed in her hair.<br><br>Rose Greenhow was a sophisticated lady of many talents, many passions. When James Buchanan was inaugurated in March 1857, she became one of the capital&#x2019;s most prominent and influential women, a close friend and confidante of the president, whom she had known for years. Although Buchanan was a lifelong bachelor, there was no suggestion that he and Rose ever had a romantic involvement, none whatsoever. In fact, historians have long thought he was asexual.<br><br>Yet Rose basked in the glow of her friendship with the president. It offered her entr�e to the highest levels of Washington society&#x2014;to the White House, the embassies, and the most exclusive salons, where political gossip was traded over fine Madeira and old port. It also gave Rose a measure of influence, which in Washington is the coin of the realm.<br><br>There were other men in her life, powerful men of equally great ambition. They pursued her; she pursued them. It was a game, Rose&#x2019;s game, and she didn&#x2019;t give a damn what anyone thought.</p><h2>The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities</h2><p><p>In this original, far-reaching, and timely book, Justice Stephen Breyer examines the work of the Supreme Court of the United States in an increasingly interconnected world, a world in which all sorts of activity, both public and private&#x2014;from the conduct of national security policy to the conduct of international trade&#x2014;obliges the Court to understand and consider circumstances beyond America&#x2019;s borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Written with unique authority and perspective, <i>The Court and the World</i> reveals an emergent reality few Americans observe directly but one that affects the life of every one of us. Here is an invaluable understanding for lawyers and non-lawyers alike.</p></p><p><b>STEPHEN BREYER</b>&nbsp;is an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. He is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C.Chapter 1<br><br><b>Silence</b><br><br>Cicero and His &#x201c;Political Question&#x201d; Counterpart<br><br>&#x201c;The Laws Fall Silent&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cicero set forth what would eventually become one of the best-�known legal principles concerning the role of courts during wartime. Two thousand years ago he wrote, &#x201c;<i>Silent enim leges inter arma</i>,&#x201d; which I should like to translate as &#x201c;When the cannons roar, the laws fall silent.&#x201d; When the senator wrote those words, he was responding to civil strife that had erupted in Rome, where armed gangs had taken control of the streets. They were never punished, for their leaders had been elected to public office. Still, we see the point of Cicero&#x2019;s remark: When the security of the state is threatened, do not expect the laws to apply. To what extent has that principle governed the actions of American courts?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the principle in the context of the American Civil War. At the very outset, President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. That ancient writ traditionally allows anyone in detention to challenge the lawfulness of his confinement by getting word to a judge that he is being held, in his view, without legal authority. And the judge can then tell the jailer, the local sheriff, say, to &#x201c;bring me the body.&#x201d; Questioning both the jailer and the prisoner, the judge can discover the legal basis, or the lack thereof, for the prisoner&#x2019;s detention. It would be difficult to point to a more important legal protection against arbitrary imprisonment.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lincoln&#x2019;s suspension of the writ in effect allowed his military to arrest civilians arbitrarily, without court review. He had seen firsthand a pressing need for such an extraordinary measure. On the way to his inauguration, he had been forced to sneak through Baltimore under cover of night in order to avoid a pro-�secession mob, while transferring from one train station to another. Lincoln knew that Union troops from the West and the North would have to negotiate the same station transfer on their way south. And he feared the effect this might have on their ability to travel, on the city of Baltimore itself, and on the State of Maryland, which itself stood on the brink of secession.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By suspending the writ, Lincoln intended to allow Northern troops to arrest disloyal Baltimore citizens. And that is just what they did. Early on the morning of May 25, 1861, on the orders of General William H. Keim, they arrested John Merryman, who had been a ringleader in anti-�Northern riots that spring, and held him at Fort McHenry, a nearby post under the command of General George Cadwalader. Merryman immediately asked a nearby federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus. And the court&#x2019;s judge, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, sitting as a local circuit judge, agreed to do so.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, Lincoln&#x2019;s actions to stop judges like Taney from issuing the writ might seem constitutional, for the Constitution authorizes suspension of the writ of habeas corpus &#x201c;when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.&#x201d; But this grant of authority appears in Article I, which deals with Congress&#x2019;s powers, not in Article II, which addresses the powers of the President. Hence, Taney concluded, the President, by acting without congressional authority, had violated the Constitution.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lincoln&#x2019;s reaction to the court&#x2019;s decision is well known. He did not release John Merryman. Neither did he appeal the ruling, as he might have done. Rather, he defended his right to take decisive unilateral action. A few weeks after Merryman&#x2019;s arrest, he asked Congress, &#x201c;Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?&#x201d; A week later Attorney General Edward Bates presented Congress with a report justifying Lincoln&#x2019;s decision to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the same day as the Bates report, Merryman was released on bail, and Lincoln did not prosecute him. And two years later Congress itself suspended the writ of habeas corpus, thereby curing the constitutional defect. The controversy about the President&#x2019;s powers fizzled out without any definite resolution.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merryman&#x2019;s detention, however, is but one of many examples of how President Lincoln suspended or sidestepped constitutional protections of civil liberty in the name of national security. He also authorized his generals to censor the press, to prevent citizens from speaking vociferously against the war (accusing the President of &#x201c;malfeasance,&#x201d; for example), to arrest suspected supporters of the enemy, and, often, to hold prisoners without trial irrespective of whether ordinary courts where they might have been tried were open and functioning. The generals exercising this authority did so by general order; they did not need to prove that, say, hostilities required their actions. In this way, they imprisoned about thirteen thousand citizens during the war. Secretary of State William H. Seward once told a British minister,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can touch a bell on my right hand and order the imprisonment of a citizen of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohio; I can touch a bell again and order the imprisonment of a citizen of New&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York;&nbsp;and no&nbsp;power on earth, except that of the President, can release them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can&nbsp;the Queen of&nbsp;England do so much?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude reflects that of many American presidents during wartime. During World War I, the Wilson administration successfully prosecuted distributors of leaflets urging resistance to the draft. It barred leftist magazines from using the mails. And it jailed Eugene V. Debs, the leader of the American Socialist Party (who subsequently received nearly one million votes in the presidential election of 1920 while incarcerated). During World War II, President Roosevelt ordered the internment of more than seventy thousand Americans of Japanese origin, an action that the Supreme Court upheld.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roosevelt&#x2019;s attorney general, Francis Biddle, once said that &#x201c;[t]he Constitution has not greatly bothered any wartime President.&#x201d; During war, the executive and legislative branches typically believe that the foreign threat&#x2014;�not the preservation of civil liberties&#x2014;�is the paramount concern. And at times throughout American history, the judiciary has agreed. While the Civil War raged, with the exception of <i>Merryman</i>, the courts did not meaningfully interfere with presidential or legislative decisions.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Civil War was over, however, the Court was in a position to take a different view, and in 1866 it heard the case of <i>Ex parte Milligan</i>. Two years earlier, just before the war&#x2019;s conclusion, a Northern general stationed with his troops in Indiana had arrested Lambdin P. Milligan and four other civilians. The general charged them with conspiring to foment an insurrection designed to help the South. He set up a special military tribunal, which tried the accused, convicted them, and passed a sentence of death. The defendants asked an ordinary federal court to hear their claim that the army could not try American citizens in a special military court, at least not when conditions in the area were peaceful and ordinary civil courts were open. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urging the Court to deny the defendants&#x2019; claim, the government&#x2019;s lawyer took a page from Cicero and argued that &#x201c;[t]he officer executing martial law is at the same time supreme legislator, supreme judge, and supreme executive. As necessity makes his will the law, he only can define and declare it.&#x201d; The government maintained that the Constitution&#x2019;s provisions protecting basic human rights are &#x201c;peace provisions . . . <i>and, like all other conventional and legislative laws and enactments, are silent amidst arms, and when the safety of the people becomes the supreme law.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court unanimously rejected this claim. All its members agreed that the Constitution&#x2019;s protections applied and that Milligan must be released. A minority of the justices added an explanation to the effect that Congress had not enacted legislation permitting military trials for civilians, implying that the result might have been different under such circumstances. The majority, however, held that the Constitution did not permit military trials of American civilians in places where, and at times when, ordinary civil courts were open, whether or not Congress enacted laws authorizing such proceedings.<br><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milligan</i>, then, represents something of a retreat on the part of the Court from the absolutism of Cicero, and a willingness to enforce constitutional protections in the face of a claim by the executive that the laws should be silent &#x201c;amidst arms.&#x201d; Still, it bears emphasizing that the case was decided only after the war had ended and relative normalcy had returned. We should not be surprised to find a different judicial attitude in later cases decided in the heat of battle, such as the World War II case of <i>Korematsu</i>. If <i>Milligan</i> signaled to the executive branch that there were limits to what the Court would permit in the name of wartime necessity, it was something less than a full or permanent flight from Cicero.<br><br>&#x201c;The Political Thicket&#x201d;<br><br>The doctrine of the &#x201c;political question&#x201d; is more specific and better developed than Cicero&#x2019;s maxim as crisis jurisprudence, but as applied to questions of national security, it is nonetheless in the same spirit. It provides a technical legal basis for courts to refuse to consider the lawfulness of presidential action taken pursuant to either his wartime or his foreign affairs powers. Indeed, by walling off many of the President&#x2019;s wartime and foreign affairs decisions from review, it is but one step removed from Cicero.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine says that in certain instances, the Constitution gives not to the courts but to other branches of government the power to decide whether an action violates the Constitution. In this way, the laws, including the Constitution, do not necessarily fall &#x201c;silent.&#x201d; They still apply to the government action in question. But it is for Congress or the President, not the courts, to determine what the law requires given the national security threat.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine has a venerable provenance. In 1803 Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>: &#x201c;By the constitution of the United States, the president is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court has since invoked the doctrine in both wartime and foreign relations cases. During the War of 1812, for example, the President called up the New York State militia for service. Jacob Mott, a member of the militia, refused to comply. He was court-martialed and convicted of refusing to report for duty. He appealed, and his case came to the Supreme Court.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mott conceded that the Constitution gives Congress the power to &#x201c;provide for calling forth the militia, to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.&#x201d; He agreed that Congress had enacted a statute stating that<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever the United States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from any foreign nation or Indian tribe, it shall be lawful for the President of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United States to call forth such number of the militia of the State or States most<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convenient to the place of danger, or scene of action, as he may judge necessary to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repel such invasion.<br><br>But, Mott argued, the President had failed to establish the presence of an &#x201c;imminent danger of invasion.&#x201d; Hence he had not met the statutory requirement. And since the Constitution gave him no independent power to call up the militia, Mott argued his call-up was impermissible.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court rejected Mott&#x2019;s claim, not because it agreed with the President about the risk of invasion, but because it thought this risk was the kind of question that the Constitution denied the Court the power to decide. Justice Joseph Story wrote that<br><br>the power to call the militia into actual service is certainly felt to be one of no ordinary magnitude. But . . . it is, in its terms, a limited power, confined to cases of actual invasion, or of imminent danger of invasion. . . . [I]s it to be considered as an open question . . . to be contested by every militia-�man who shall refuse to obey the orders of the President? We are all of opinion, that the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen, <i>belongs exclusively to the President</i>, and that his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court further developed the &#x201c;political question&#x201d; doctrine during the 1840s, in a case concerning the government of Rhode Island. The petitioners had argued that the new state constitution&#x2014;�under which their rivals had claimed authority and called upon the federal government for military support&#x2014;�violated the federal Constitution&#x2019;s guarantee of a &#x201c;republican form of government.&#x201d; But the Supreme Court held that the matter was a &#x201c;political question,&#x201d; grounding its decision in the idea that the political branches should have unfettered power over national security matters. Referring back to Mott&#x2019;s case, Chief Justice Taney explained why the Court could not second-�guess a determination by Congress or the President as to the legitimacy of a state&#x2019;s government:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the President has acted and called out the militia [in support of one group alleging to be the true state government], is a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right? Could the court, while the parties were actually contending in arms for the possession of the government, call witnesses before it and inquire which party represented a majority of the people? If it could, then it would become the duty of the court (provided it came to the conclusion that the President had decided incorrectly) to discharge those who were arrested or detained by the troops in the service of the United States or the government which the President was endeavoring to maintain. If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same theme would be expounded by the Court into the twentieth century, in <i>Chicago &amp; Southern Airlines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp</i>., a case involving the award of an international airline route. A statute had given the courts the power to review route awards to airlines by the Civil Aeronautics Board. The Court, however, held that this power did not apply when the President himself had approved the final decision. That is because, as Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p><h2>Thrill Ride (Black Knights Inc., 4)</h2><p><p><strong><em>A New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> Bestseller!</strong></p><p>"A first-rate thrill ride."&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, Starred Review</p><p><strong>HE'S GONE ROGUE</strong></p><p>Ex-navy SEAL Rock Babineaux is as Cajun as they come&#x2015;spicy, sexy, and more than a bit wicked.

HQ</p> <p>Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois...</p> <p>"They say he's gone rogue."</p> <p>Like a bad smell, the sentence seemed to hang in the air. Those seated around the large conference table shifted uncomfortably, their expressions varying from wary disbelief to stubborn denial.</p> <p>Vanessa Cordero found herself falling into that last group. He wouldn't. Not Rock.</p> <p>"Who's they?" Ozzie asked. The guy's wild blond hair and Star Trek T-shirt-it read I beat the Kobayashi Maru-shouted of his secure position in the upper echelons of Geekdom as loudly as the three microsized laptops open in front of him.</p> <p>"Official word came down through the DOD," Boss said, pulling out a chair and wearily sinking into it. Frank "Boss" Knight, their esteemed leader, was built like an Abrams tank. Of course, right now he looked more like Atlas-the weight of the world squarely on his big shoulders.</p> <p>"The DOD?" Ozzie snorted, and Vanessa watched his youthful face contort with skepticism. "Well that makes it all clear as mud, now doesn't it?"</p> <p>The Department of Defense oversaw all facets of government intelligence and defense from the NSA down to the individual branches of the military. So, yeah, saying the information came from the DOD was ambiguous at best, and downright cryptic at worst.</p> <p>Boss's jaw hardened. He seemed to hesitate before finally opening the accordion-style folder tucked under his arm. Pulling out a stack of bundled papers, he tossed them into the middle of the table. "Pass 'em around," he commanded.</p> <p>Vanessa was almost afraid to take one. Afraid of what the information might reveal and-</p> <p>No. He wouldn't do this. Not Rock.</p> <p>Not the man who'd laughingly and patiently endeavored to teach her to make the perfect roux for a pot of gumbo despite the fact she totally botched and burned the first three attempts. Not the man who'd calmly showed her how to handle a motorcycle even though she kept laying the sucker over on its side. Not the man who'd scooped her up in his arms and carried her two miles back to Black Knights Inc. headquarters the time she twisted an ankle while the group was out jogging.</p> <p>Not Rock...</p> <p>The whine of an electric screwdriver sounded below, and Boss pushed up from his chair to stomp over to the railing. BKI's command center occupied the second floor of an old three-story menthol cigarette factory and overlooked the custom motorcycle shop-the cover for their covert government defense firm-on the first floor below. As Ozzie liked to joke, they were grease-monkey motorcycle mechanics by day and Uncle Sam's last resort by night.</p> <p>And one of them had just been accused of going rogue...</p> <p>A shiver of trepidation raced up Vanessa's spine. A rogue operator was considered worse than a traitor. And what was the government's stance on traitors?</p> <p>That'd be death. Pure and simple.</p> <p>Shitballs. What a nightmare.</p> <p>"Becky!" Boss yelled as the pages he'd thrown on the table were distributed around the group. His booming bass made her wince, as usual. "Get your ass up here! We have a problem!"</p> <p>A problem? Is that what he called it when every agent and operator employed by the dear, sweet U.S. of A. was going to be gunning for one of their own-when they would be required to gun for one of their own? If so, she hated to know what he considered a catastrophe.</p> <p>The electric screwdriver clicked off and, seconds later, the thump of Becky's work boots pounded up the metal treads. The hollow sound echoed throughout the building and inside Vanessa's tight chest. And, yep, the fact that the room was doing a slow tilt probably had something to do with the fact that she hadn't taken a breath since Boss dropped the bomb. Clamping her eyes shut, she forced herself to rake in much needed oxygen. When she heard Becky arrive on the second floor landing, she cracked an eyelid only to discover the woman's blond ponytail covered in metal shavings. They acted as sparkling accessories to the grease spots staining her shirt.</p> <p>Becky Reichert was the reason their cover worked so well. Because while most of the guys were pretty handy with a wrench, she was the genius behind the kick-ass motorcycle designs that convinced the general public they were exactly what they were purported to be-simply one of the world's premier custom bike shops.</p> <p>"Has anyone ever mentioned you bellow like a wounded bull?" Becky demanded, hands on hips, lollipop stick protruding from her pursed lips as she glared at Boss. And, yes, Vanessa would wholeheartedly agree with that assessment.</p> <p>"Just you, honey." Boss pulled the bright red sucker from her mouth, bending to give her a quick, smacking kiss.</p> <p>When he straightened away, Becky accurately read his I-really-need-to-hit-something expression, because the teasing light in her eyes instantly dimmed. "What is it, Frank?" she breathed. "What's happened?"</p> <p>"General Fuller just called to inform me Rock has officially been listed as a rogue operator."</p> <p>"What the hell!" Becky exclaimed, taking the sucker back from Boss. She bit down on the lollipop and chewed viciously, taking out her shock and disbelief on the innocent candy.</p> <p>"It's true," Boss insisted, pulling out a chair for his fianc�e. "And we need to get to the bottom of it."</p> <p>"I'm not sure we're going to like what we find once we get there," Mac said in his slow Texas drawl, his bluebell-colored eyes narrowing, his brow furrowing as he flipped through the stapled papers in his hand. "This evidence could be pretty damning."</p> <p>The coffee in Vanessa's stomach-which never sat well anyway, since most of the Knights preferred their java to have the general consistency of syrup-burned like battery acid. If any of them knew anything about damning evidence, it was Bryan "Mac" McMillan, former all-star FBI agent.</p> <p>Hesitantly, she looked away from Mac's worried gaze to peer down at the thin packet in her hand, her unease increasing as her eyes skimmed each postage stamp&#x2013;sized photo and the brief blurb beside it. "All of them?" she croaked, glancing up at Boss in disbelief. "He's supposed to have killed all of them?"</p> <p>"Yep." Boss nodded.</p> <p>"But most of these deaths look accidental. A heart attack, a car accident, a drowning...Why are they pinning these on Rock?"</p> <p>"Something about a tip on a PO box in Rock's name that contained a bunch of files on these guys," Boss said.</p> <p>"And there are untold ways of making a murder look accidental," Ozzie added.</p> <p>"Here's something interesting," Mac observed, mouth thinned. "Each of these men was kidnapped at one point, and none held for ransom. They all just suddenly reappeared and went about their lives. The local law enforcement was never able to discover who'd held them."</p> <p>"Yeah," Boss nodded. "I found that extremely odd as well. And since it's the only clue we have to go on, I'm having Ozzie compare the dates of those kidnappings to see if any of them coincide with the times we knew Rock poofed out of BKI."</p> <p>"But why would he do this?" Vanessa realized what she said, shook her head, and rephrased. "I mean why are they saying he did it? Killing these men...What could possibly be his motivation?"</p> <p>"Money?" Ozzie posited, frowning at his computer screens. "Says here, these men were all very wealthy. Having Rock eighty-six them might've proved extremely lucrative for some folks. You know, family members, rival business associates..."</p> <p>"No way," Vanessa jerked her chin from side-to-side, more convinced than ever this was all a giant smelly load of bullcrap. "Have you seen how he dresses? Do you think he'd go around wearing beat-up Levi's, holey T-shirts, and scuffed-up alligator boots if he was sitting on a big pile of cash?" She pointed at the dossier with a finger she was disgusted to find was shaking. Hastily, she clenched her hand into a fist and hid it in her lap. Her number one rule since coming to work for BKI: show no fear. The Knights were all hardcore, hard-assed operators who didn't so much as flinch when they were staring death in the face, and she didn't want to find herself labeled the weak link. "Now if you told me it was Christian," she continued doggedly, "I might believe you. No offense, Christian." She made a face at the former SAS officer who, as usual, was sporting designer jeans and a cashmere sweater that probably cost more than most peoples' monthly car payments.</p> <p>"None taken, my dear," Christian said, his smooth British accent a minor balm to her screaming nerves. "As it happens, I tend to agree with you. If Rock had, indeed, accumulated the level of wealth likely to come from performing hits on these men, why was he still messing about with us? Why wasn't he sitting on a beach somewhere, soaking up the sun and ordering umbrella drinks from some bird in a bikini?"</p> <p>Vanessa glanced around the table at the faces of the people she'd come to love like family. Their expressions gave her little comfort. It was obvious they were as confused and scared as she was, which-oh dear, sweet, baby Jesus-had the coffee/acid in her stomach burning its way up the back of her throat.</p> <p>The Black Knights were not supposed to get scared. Hardcore, hard-assed operators who didn't flinch while staring death in the face, remember?</p> <p>She swallowed hastily and pushed ahead. The silence was deafening...and damning. She couldn't stand it. "Well, one thing we know," she grasped at the first straw to come to mind, "is he wasn't working alone."</p> <p>"The phone calls." Ozzie halted his typing. "He always got one of those strange phone calls right before he disappeared. Which means he had an accomplice in all this."</p> <p>"Accomplice? Wait a minute," Becky interjected, yanking a new sucker from her mouth-this one was purple-to point it at Ozzie. "You're making it sound like you think he's guilty."</p> <p>"I'm not saying anything." Ozzie held up his hands. "I'm just saying he was Mr. Mum on the subject of his second job, he did have the tendency to vanish at odd times, and he was working with someone and-" His laptop dinged, and his face drained of blood. Vanessa's stomach dropped down to the floor in response.</p> <p>Ozzie turned his computer around. On the screen were two columns. The first one showed the dates of the kidnappings. The second one showed the dates Rock had disappeared off the face of the planet.</p> <p>The two columns matched perfectly.</p> <p>Boss let loose with a string of curses that would do any sailor proud. "Okay, so there's obviously a link between these men and Rock's other job."</p> <p>The job that they'd all thought revolved around some shadowy government entity. The job that, according to these recent revelations, obviously wasn't related to the government at all.</p> <p>Holy shitburgers! Vanessa was going to pass out. The room was no longer tilting; it was spinning like a merry-go-round. She lowered her head to the table and tried to slow her breathing as happy little stars pranced on the backs of her eyelids-so much for that whole hardhearted operator facade.</p> <p>Is it possible? Could he have done it? Just contemplating the thought made her temples pound in rhythm to her racing heart.</p> <p>"What?" She heard Becky ask, confusion evident in the woman's voice. "Why does everyone look like they've just seen a ghost?"</p> <p>"Our government isn't allowed to assassinate its citizens," Boss answered, his voice so rough it sounded like he'd scoured his vocal cords with steel wool. "And each of these guys, down to a man, was an American, born and bred."</p> <p>A tense silence once more settled over the group, and Vanessa raised her thousand-pound head from the table. "Really? We're really sitting here contemplating the fact that he's guilty? Rock Babineaux? Ex&#x2013;Navy SEAL? Founding member of BKI and ragin' Cajun who's more patriotic than the whole lot of us put together?"</p> <p>Rock Babineaux, the man who was witty and courageous and, surprisingly-given his testosterone-laced occupation and training-incredibly self-effacing and modest? Rock Babineaux, the man who'd made her want to throw her rule about not dating operators right out the window?</p> <p>Her pleading gaze landed on Boss. Please don't lead us down this path. Please tell me you know Rock wouldn't have done this.</p> <p>Boss's Adam's apple bobbed, and for a moment she held her breath. Then she heaved a shaky sigh of relief when he adamantly shook his head. "Hell, no. It's been my experience that when everything is as neat and tidy as this report is," he flicked a scarred finger at the document in question, "then something is way the hell off. Nothing is ever this black and white."</p> <p>She clung to the certainty she heard in his voice because, yes, for a second there she'd actually begun to have her doubts.</p> <p>"I agree, Boss," Ozzie said, closing the lids on his laptops so he could place his forearms on the conference table and lean forward. "And here's something else I don't get: if Rock's second job wasn't government sanctioned and no one in the government save for El Jefe and his JCs knows about the true status of our organization"-the Black Knights had been run autonomously by the president and his Joint Chiefs for over four years. In fact, their direct report was the head of the Joint Chiefs himself, General Pete Fuller-"then how the hell can the DOD list him as a rogue operator? As far as they know, he's just an ex&#x2013;Navy SEAL turned motorcycle mechanic. So, what gives?"</p> <p>Boss whispered a quick profanity that questioned the legitimacy of the births of everyone working in the DOD. And, uh-oh, his I'm-gonna-kill-somebody expression all but screamed that what he had to tell them wasn't going to fall under the happy little banner of Good News.</p> <p>Great, Vanessa thought. I knew I should've just gone back to bed this morning.</p> <p>When she'd stubbed her pinkie toe on the way to the restroom, run out of conditioner in the shower, and nearly electrocuted herself when her blow-dryer decided to spontaneously combust, she'd had a feeling it was going to be one hellaciously craptastic day.</p> <p>She hadn't had a clue...</p> <p>"If you'll look at your dossiers," Boss began, leafing through his own packet, "you'll see the last man Rock supposedly killed was one Fred Billingsworth. Now, Fred was a super high-tech and super-secret private investigator. Which means he didn't spend his time trying to catch cheating spouses or insurance scammers but, instead, was hired out exclusively to major corporations. As far as anyone can tell, his last job was working for some Democratic Party support group. He was supposed to dig up what dirt he could on all the potential candidates for the presidency next election season. As you can imagine, given the tenuous and sensitive nature of his investigations, when he died, the case was quickly taken over from local law enforcement by the FBI. Somehow, and I don't know how, they got a bead on Rock and that PO box which, along with all these other guys, contained a file on Billingsworth. When General Fuller found out, he had to come clean to the powers that be in the Intelligence community about the true nature of our business here or risk having the investigation fall on all our heads."</p> <p>That got everyone's attention. One of the main reasons the Black ...</p></p><h2>Climb the Family Tree, Jesse Bear!</h2><p><b>Are we there yet?<br> Are we there yet?<br> We're here, Jesse Bear!<br> We're here!</b> <br> At his family reunion, Jesse Bear visits with aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins galore.

And he was one that would just as soon kill a man, or a Breed, who got in his way as he was to look at him. Yet, he&#x2019;d been working with the Bureau of Breed Affairs for years, and he did so without killing anyone.</p><p>Was it a testament to Jonas Wyatt&#x2019;s skill as a commander or simply his control over the animal genetics that were so much a part of the Breeds he commanded?

Black eyes gleamed with amusement each time she caught him watching her. Each time she caught him, he would deliberately allow his eyes to flick to the upper mounds of her breasts where they rose above the exercise bra.</p><p>As she felt his gaze pin her once again, she turned her head and glared up at him through the veil of her lashes. The fact that she could tell when he was staring down at her, and all that had moved were his eyes, was distinctly disconcerting. Bothering her even more was the fact that her nipples were hardening further with each look. Having such a response to a man, any man, wasn&#x2019;t a situation she wanted to deal with, especially with a Breed.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you comfortable?&#x201d; his voice rumbled with a primal, erotic rasp that sent a shiver of sensation racing up her spine.</p><p>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>She was distinctly uncomfortable with the warmth traveling across her nerve endings as the sensitive flesh of her clit tingled in interest.</p><p>As far as she was concerned, this was the wrong man, or Breed, and the wrong time for such an attraction.</p><p>&#x201c;You could sit on my lap,&#x201d; he suggested with a slow smile as he patted a hard, well-muscled thigh. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty of room.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, hell&#x2014;</p><p>The real problem where that question was concerned was that she was way, way too tempted.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you.&#x201d; Jerking her head forward, she stared between the front seats to the road beyond.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be more than happy to accommodate you.&#x201d; Leaning closer, he all but whispered the words in her ear.</p><p>Oh, she just bet he would.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t have the breath to put that &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; in there a second time.</p><p>Chills were racing over her skin, tearing up her spine and, she swore, sizzling in her lower stomach.

She wanted him to touch her, to hold her, to give her what she had so far managed to deny herself. To share a bed with a man, or with a Breed, and to learn all the things sexually that she hadn&#x2019;t really had an interest in until now.</p><p>And why now?</p><p>Never had she ever had a reaction like this to any man, let alone a Breed.</p><p>As he sat back in his seat, she peeked up at him, swallowing deeply at the impression of pure raw power that surrounded him like an invisible mantle.</p><p>Dark- skinned, more so than any other Breed she had seen before, he was rumored to have the DNA of a rogue black Wolf and a voodoo priestess, and the dark bronze tone of his skin refl ected both.</p><p>His eyes were as black as midnight with what appeared at times to be small pinpoints of blue. His jaw was so hard, so arrogant and savagely hewn she knew he would be as stubborn as hell.</p><p>High cheekbones, strong, arched brows, and such long thick black lashes, they simply made her jealous.</p><p>His skin fascinated her. Darker than the strongest tan, but it wasn&#x2019;t black. It was simply such a dark, dark earth tone that she wondered if it held the warmth and vibrancy of the earth it so reminded her of.</p><p>The name, <i>Stygian Black</i>; the name suited him.</p><p>The black eyes, the nut brown flesh, the air of power and strength.</p><p>Damn, she could feel him watching her again. Her shoulders were tingling.</p><p>Narrowing her eyes, she glanced up, glared&#x2014;</p><p>She could do without another once-over, if he didn&#x2019;t mind. If she became much more interested in the fact that he was glancing at the upper curves of her breasts&#x2014;</p><p>The sound of Braden clearing his throat from the driver&#x2019;s seat as he slid the driver&#x2019;s-side window down an inch or so had a flush of raging embarrassment staining her face. It was probably staining her entire body, damn it.</p><p>Flattening her lips, she considered kicking him, but he was wearing those damned black boots Breeds wore with their mission uniforms. She&#x2019;d read they were so tough that a snakebite couldn&#x2019;t even penetrate them. She doubted he&#x2019;d even feel her foot slamming into his shin.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>The bastard.</p><p>&#x201c;Leave me alone.&#x201d; Pushing the words through clenched teeth as she clenched her thighs against those stirrings of arousal, she wondered if there wasn&#x2019;t some way to get the door open and just push him out of the moving vehicle.</p><p>&#x201c;How am I bothering you?&#x201d; he murmured with such false innocence that the Breed on the other side of her actually chuckled.</p><p>If only she had a few more years&#x2019; training on her. That vehicle-tossing thing was something Callum was really good at; perhaps she could have convinced him to teach it to her.</p><p>As it was, in a physical confrontation with a man like Stygian, her only hope was in simply running.</p><p>And she had a feeling she couldn&#x2019;t run far enough or fast enough to get away from this Breed.</p><p>If the look in his eyes was any indication, running wouldn&#x2019;t be an option.</p><p>No, a Breed would expect her to mildly stand in place until he gave her the order to do otherwise.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t think so.</p><p>Turning back to stare out the front window, Liza tightened her arms beneath her breasts and gave him something to look at. Or to slobber over, she thought. He was definitely acting like a dog.</p><p>Yeah, she knew the sports bra plumped her breasts and left her belly bare. She knew her running pants were a little snug and she wasn&#x2019;t wearing panties beneath them.</p><p>But did he have to act as though he knew it as well?</p><p>Because each time his gaze flicked over her, the warmth that suffused her flesh was just irritating. She didn&#x2019;t need this. This was the last thing she needed. An attraction to a Breed would completely foul up her plans, and she really didn&#x2019;t need that at the moment.</p><p>A hard turn to the right threw her against him before she could brace herself. Instantly, his arm went around her, the powerful, bare flesh of his forearm heating her skin where it touched her lower arm, while his hand quickly gripped her hip.</p><p>She had to swallow tight as she held on to the edge of her seat, refusing to look at him.</p><p>Breeds had no true body hair, she&#x2019;d heard. What they had were tiny, almost invisible hairs more closely resembling a fi ne pelt.</p><p>She believed it now.</p><p>She could feel it.</p><p>Each invisible, silken hair caressed her overly sensitive flesh everywhere they touched.</p><p>The Desert Dragoon bounced across the rough terrain until it hit the smoother road leading to the hotel and, thankfully, stopped jostling her against him every other second.</p><p>Unfortunately, it did nothing to force him to remove his arm.</p><p>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for that strength wrapped around her and the fingers gripping her hip, however, she would have been thrown into the driver&#x2019;s seat when the vehicle came to a screeching stop at the back entrance of the hotel.</p><p>Breeds piled out. Stygian Black lifted Liza from the vehicle.</p><p>Then, surrounded by big, burly bodies, she was pushed through the entrance to an elevator. Within seconds, she stepped out onto the secure fifth floor, which was reserved for Breeds alone.</p><p>Would explanations now be forthcoming?</p><p>They damned well better be. The last she&#x2019;d heard, Breeds were not exempt from the legal repercussions of kidnapping. Jonas Wyatt, the goons&#x2019; boss, better have some damned answers.</p><p>And didn&#x2019;t it just figure that he wasn&#x2019;t there?</p><p>Instead, a team of Breeds were in place with their electronic bug detectors.</p><p>Each member of the team that had brought her in was scanned thoroughly before Stygian took the device from one of the team members and turned to her with a grin.</p><p>&#x201c;Just get it over with,&#x201d; she ordered, frustration running rampant through her body as she lifted her arms and waited.</p><p>And prayed the earbud and skin tags were as undetectable as Cullen was certain they were.</p><p>&#x201c;Testy today, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Stygian grinned before moving the paddle- shaped device over her body.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think with all the technology you guys have going for you, you wouldn&#x2019;t be working with such antiquated electronics.&#x201d; She eyed the twenty-year-old device skeptically.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let looks fool you,&#x201d; he murmured as he ran the wand over her head.</p><p>Her heart nearly tripped from her chest as he paused at her ear. A second later the device was moving again, then pausing on the other side as well.</p><p>Thank God Cullen had instituted shutting the earbuds down completely when in the presence of Breeds.</p><p>Giving her a small, flirtatious little wink, he turned and handed the device over to the Breed next to him before, surprisingly, striding to the door and leaving the suite entirely.</p><p>Liza turned to Megan questioningly. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s he going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s part of the independent security force,&#x201d; Megan answered, her dark brown gaze amused. &#x201c;Trust me, he&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;</p><p>Trust her? At one time, years ago, she had trusted Megan Fields with her life. Now, trust wasn&#x2019;t so easy. She was a Breed mate, and because she was a Breed mate, her fi rst thought was for the Breed community, rather than friends, and in many areas, even family.</p><p>Trust her? Trust any of them?</p><p>Liza looked around the room, taking in the hard gazes and ready stances of each person in the room.</p><p>She really didn&#x2019;t think so.</p><p>Stepping into the connecting room, Stygian glanced at the monitors on the wall, watching as Ms. Liza Johnson shifted uncomfortably and gazed around with a resigned expression.</p><p>Turning to Jonas, he was at fi rst taken aback. He always was, whenever he saw the hard- assed, merciless, manipulating director of the Bureau of Breed Affairs cradling the too-delicate toddler he&#x2019;d taken as his own.</p><p>Amber was curled against his chest, delicate and frail, her normally bright blue eyes closed, her breathing gentle and easy for a change.</p><p>It was one of the rare times he hadn&#x2019;t sensed the baby&#x2019;s pain when in her presence. For now, despite the hell she&#x2019;d been through in the past two years, she was at peace.</p><p>&#x201c;Just keep your voice low and you won&#x2019;t disturb her,&#x201d; Jonas assured him.</p><p>Wiping his hand over the back of his neck, he pushed back his frustration before grimacing. &#x201c;They attacked, as we knew they would.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonas nodded, thoughtful for a moment before replying.</p><p>&#x201c;Malcolm&#x2019;s team moved in the minute they thought she was unprotected,&#x201d; he murmured as Stygian watched him closely. &#x201c;I was listening to the reports as they came in. Lawe and Diane are fine, by the way. They&#x2019;re heading back to the hotel now and should show up in the next five minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She kicked his ass then?&#x201d; Stygian asked with a grin as he thought of the cocky, traitorous Malcolm.</p><p>&#x201c;Was there any doubt?&#x201d; Jonas grinned. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a hell of an addition to the Bureau, though Lawe has definitely bowed out of the assistant director position.&#x201d;</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t really a surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;Lawe prefers the field and now he has a mate to share that with,&#x201d; he agreed as Jonas&#x2019;s lips tightened.</p><p>The director had been certain Lawe Justice would take the position of assistant director.</p><p>Those who knew Lawe had known better.</p><p>Jonas glanced at the monitor then, watching Liza thoughtfully, before murmuring, &#x201c;Ms. Johnson wasn&#x2019;t alone either, was she?&#x201d;</p><p>Stygian grunted at the comment. &#x201c;That girl is never alone. She had two shadows on her ass and two lying farther back from the minute she left her house, just as she&#x2019;s had every morning. And they&#x2019;re damned good. They&#x2019;re always damned good. And she knew they were there.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonas turned his head, his brows lifting curiously at the information. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damned straight,&#x201d; he growled. &#x201c;To add to it, she has a deactivated earbud tucked completely out of sight in that dainty little ear of hers and three skin tags. One on each hip and one on her left shoulder.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then her shadows are friendly?&#x201d; Jonas leaned back in his chair carefully, propping one expensively shod foot on the coffee table as he ensured not so much as a shift of movement disturbed his toddler.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t budge. One little hand lay at his neck, the other beneath her cheek. The soft pink- and-white frilly dress she wore looked at odds against the black shirt and shoulder holster it lay against on Jonas&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>&#x201c;The shadows are friendly.&#x201d; Stygian nodded. &#x201c;Between her and them is the enemy.&#x201d; He sighed. &#x201c;The ones I glimpsed the other morning as she went to work are not part of Dog&#x2019;s team. But we already knew that.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonas nodded slowly as he gently, rhythmically, rubbed his daughter&#x2019;s back.</p><p>She was the reason Jonas was there; the reason he was searching desperately for ghosts.</p><p>&#x201c;What do we have, Stygian?&#x201d; he asked as he stared out over the tiny head tucked beneath his chin.</p><p>The girl&#x2019;s once-brown locks, still thick with a slight curl, were now tricolored. Golden blond and sunset red streaked the once dark brown strands as though nature hadn&#x2019;t yet made up her mind what color the child&#x2019;s hair would be.</p><p>&#x201c;Hell if know.&#x201d; Stygian breathed out roughly. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s important t...</p></p><h2>Batgirl 2: Son of Penguin</h2><p>After a globe-trotting adventure with the greatest fighters on Earth, Barbara Gordon&#x2014;a.k.a.

Superbly illustrated with more than 150 specially commissioned color photographs, <em>Arts and Crafts of Morocco</em> illuminates the wonders of this thriving tradition.<br><br> Dr. James F. Jereb&#x2019;s pioneering account, based on his own first hand research, examines an extensive range of media: vibrantly colored textiles; jewelry in a range of exquisite configurations; original leather, wood, and metalwork; and an enormous variety of pottery and ceramics. These marvelous objects derive either from a rural lifestyle, with symbols and patterns that reflect the powerful animistic beliefs of the Berber country artisans, or from the cities, where Islamic tenets compose the cultural foundation. All of these works are thus endowed with a spiritually charged significance that determines their functions and ensures their remarkable beauty.<br><br> This in-depth study is made complete with guidance on Moroccan arts and crafts from expert collectors and a revealing analysis of the belief systems, festivals, and ceremonies that inform the predominant techniques and visual motifs of Moroccan art. 200 illustrations, 151 in color</p><p>The spectacular arts and crafts of Morocco reflect a timeless mingling of influences from Moorish Spain, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East - all the exotic worlds that once congregated at this crossroads of ancient trading routes. Striking in its versatility and diversity, Moroccan art has long influenced artists, architects, and designers. This volume, superbly illustrated with more than 150 original color photographs, brings the dazzling splendor of a thriving artisan tradition to a wider and increasingly appreciative international audience. Vibrantly colored textiles; exquisitely crafted jewelry: finely worked leather, wood, metal; and an enormous collection of pottery and ceramics are all gathered together in this engaging guide by a leading Morroco scholar. These marvelous objects are inspired in form and content by the tribal lifestyle and powerful animistic beliefs of the nomadic artisans, as well as by the compelling aesthetic traditions of the Moslem world, giving each item&#39;s utility and remarkable beauty a spiritual resonance. With a lively text describing traditional artistic forms and techniques, and a comprehensive analysis of the belief systems, festivals, and ceremonies to which the arts are linked, Arts and Crafts of Morocco will prove irresistible not only to those intrigued by this fascinating land, but also to collectors, designers, and anyone in search of original decorative ideas.Visual artist Dr. James F.

He became by turns the first Director of the US Bureau of Statistics, the American delegate to the International Monetary Congress in both Turin and St. Petersburg, and commissioner to the US Monetary Commission, set up to investigate the Panic of 1873, (which had led to a worldwide economic depression).&nbsp; His conclusion, (that bank reserves had been far too small for the amount of notes issued), made him unpopular in academic circles, and his prescient views were all but ignored.&nbsp; Others, however, recognised his virtues.&nbsp; John Stuart Mill called Del Mar a man with &#x201c;...stuff in him. He knows what he is about. He is the sort of man to put things right ... in any country&#x201d;.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Golden Cat: A Novel (del Rey Fantasy)</h2><p><b>In <i>The Golden Cat</i>, Gabriel King continues the enchanting quest that began with <i>The Wild Road</i>&#x2014;the novel the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> crowned &#x201c;mythical,&#x201d; and Richard Adams, author of <i>Watership Down</i>, deemed &#x201c;absolutely magical. . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<br></b><br>The ancient prophecy speaks of a golden cat whose coming will heal the troubled world.

In Manila, the vessel was loaded with the scented spices of the East, luxurious silks from China, exquisite hand crafted lacquerware from Japan and a multitude of Oriental goods that the Spaniards of New Spain longed to own. The returning galleon from Acapulco to Manila, carried as much as 2.5 million silver pesos in payment of the goods sent to the New Spain in the previous year, as well as a yearly silver subsidy of 250,000 reales for the maintenance of the colonial government in the Philippines. But while the galleons mainly sailed alone and unaccompanied from Manila to Acapulco and vice versa, they were vulnerable to a host of calamities and misfortunes. A fire on board the vessel or a terrifying storm could end the voyage and the lives of every one on the ship even before the galleon was able to reach land. Additionally, the commanders of the galleons were always threatened by lurking pirates and privateers who preyed on the vessels and coveted the treasures they carried. The book describes in detail how the galleons were attacked at sea and how they fought against enemy vessels, as well as how many of the ships sank or were shipwrecked over the years. It also covers their management, construction, manning, weaponry, navigation, daily life on the ship, provisions, cargoes and voyages. The book contains an annotated list of the galleons sailing between the Philippines and Mexico from 1565 to 1815. This informative book is the first of its kind to cover such an expansive history of the Pacific galleons which up to this point had remained largely untold.</p><p>Shirley Fish is an American Freelance Writer and Researcher working in Asia since 1980.

The outgrowth of a project begun by Grace L. Tracey and completed by John P. Dern, it presents a detailed account of landholdings in that part of western Maryland that eventually became Frederick County. At the same time it provides a history of the inhabitants of the area, from the early traders and explorers to the farsighted investors and speculators, from the original Quaker settlers to the Germans of central Frederick County.<br>In essence, the book has a dual focus. First it attempts to locate and describe the land of the early settlers. This is done by means of a superb series of plat maps, drawn to scale from original surveys and based both on certificates of survey and patents. These show, in precise configurations, the exact locations of the various grants and lots, the names of owners and occupiers, the dates of surveys and patents, and the names of contiguous land owners. Second, it identifies the early settlers and inhabitants of the area, carefully following them through deeds, wills, and inventories, judgment records, and rent rolls.<br>Finally, in meticulously compiled appendices it provides a chronological list of surveys between 1721 and 1743; an alphabetical list of surveys, giving dates, page reference--text and maps--and patent references; a list of taxables for 1733-34; and a list of the early German settlers of Frederick County, showing their religion, their location, dates of arrival, and their earliest records in the county.<br>Winner of the 1988 Donald Lines Jacobus Award!</p><p></p><h2>Kiki Smith</h2><p>This richly illustrated book offers a full retrospective of Kiki Smith&#x2019;s work. Artist Kiki Smith has produced an astoundingly varied body of work that deals powerfully with the political, social, philosophical, and spiritual aspects of human nature&#x2014;especially in the way they relate to women. Smith&#x2019;s earlier works reflect the social discourse of the 1980s, particularly focusing on death and the AIDS epidemic. She later turned to issues of feminism, abortion rights, and animal rights. This comprehensive book provides an overview of Smith&#x2019;s artistic development, focusing on her sculpture, from the early 1980s to the present day. Images of her radical, unflinching work reveal an artist who is not afraid to explore subjects such as the human body or a society&#x2019;s archetypes. Filled with the beauty, vitality, and charm that are the hallmarks of Kiki Smith&#x2019;s art, this book urges viewers to think and feel.</p><p>Petra Giloy-Hirtz is a curator based in Munich.

If he wasn't good-looking enough to be a whore in L.A. he sure as hell wasn't going to make it as a movie star. But it was too late to go home now. Too late to admit he didn't have what it took. Too hard to face everyone who'd told him so.<br><br>He did have talent. Won the top role in every school play. Got a job at the summer theater three years running. Did two TV commercials for local businesses. So, at sixteen, tired of his parents telling him to go to college first, he'd taken his savings and come to L.A.<br><br>Now the money was gone and he'd found no decent way to earn more, and if this couple wanted what he figured they wanted, that was fine by him. They had kind faces. Maybe in Hollywood that didn't count for shit, but where he'd come from it meant something.<br><br>They'd driven him to their home in Brentwood. He'd recognized the neighborhood from a "Star Tours" bus trip he'd taken when he first arrived. He'd sat in the back of their SUV, peering out the tinted windows into the night, watching the fabled neighborhood pass. They'd pulled into the garage of a modest-looking house, then led him inside. They'd offered food, but he'd claimed he wasn't hungry, despite his rumbling stomach. He might be naive, but he knew better than to accept food or drink.<br><br>When they'd taken him downstairs, through a TV room into a guest bedroom, he'd been certain this was where the situation would change. But they'd only turned on the lights, pointed out the adjoining washroom and said they'd see him in the morning. They hadn't even closed the door, but left it ajar, so he wouldn't feel locked in.<br><br>Now, as he fought the urge to sleep, footsteps sounded on the stairs. The woman's voice, sharp with an accent. Then the man's. Then another man's. And another . . . <br><br>Oh, shit.<br><br>Heart hammering, he tried to rouse himself. Why was he so tired? Goddamn it, he had to make a break for it, before he found himself in the middle of a gang bang or&#x2013;<br><br>Outside, in the TV room, the woman offered refreshments. Two of the men asked for wine, the third accepted water. Then their voices settled into one place, as if they were sitting.<br><br>Wine and conversation as a prelude to sex games with a teenage boy?<br><br>Brendan strained to make out their words. They were talking about books. "Texts" as they called them, tossing around words like belief and ritual, debating the different translated meanings of Hebrew and Latin versions.<br><br>Latin. That's what the woman had been speaking earlier. As he'd been getting into their car, she had been saying something to the man in another language, and with her accent, Brendan had figured she was reverting to her mother tongue to relay a private message. The language, though, had sounded familiar. Now he knew why. As a Christmas and Easter Catholic, he'd heard enough Latin.<br><br>Now these people were discussing religious texts, and that couldn't be a coincidence. The couple had said they wanted to help, as penance for their mistakes with their son. Good Samaritans.<br><br>"&#x2013;too old," one man was saying, his voice rising enough for Brendan to hear him easily. "All of our success has been with kids much younger, and I don't understand why we need to change that now."<br><br>"We aren't changing," another man said. "We're expanding and experimenting. There's a limited supply of younger children out there and it's difficult getting access to them. If we can adjust the procedure to work successfully with teens, we open the door to limitless possibilities."<br><br>"Don's right." The woman again. "One or two a year isn't enough, not for the scale we . . ."<br><br>Her voice dropped soothingly until, once again, Brendan could only catch the odd word.<br><br>He couldn't blame them for setting their sights on children. By his age, most street kids had no interest in "rescue." They were too immersed in the life to accept help. But he would. Drugs weren't a problem&#x2013;he'd never been able to afford them. They could spout all the Bible verses they wanted and he'd smile and agree if it meant getting on a bus home. He could tell his parents he hadn't failed; he'd just had a religious experience and had changed his mind.<br><br>He closed his eyes and pictured himself walking up his drive, imagined his mother's face, his little sister's squeals, his father's expression&#x2013;stern but relieved.<br><br>The conversation outside his door seemed to have turned to a heated debate on the nature of suffering. Yeah, he thought with a chuckle, definitely Catholic. From what he could make out, it sounded a hell of a lot like a conversation between two Goths he'd overheard last week.<br><br>Morbid. The word popped into his head and he turned it over in his mind. A cool word. Described Goths and some religious types alike&#x2013;that fixation with death and suffering.<br><br>In the room beyond, a male voice had picked up volume again.<br><br>"&#x2013;Romans used crucifixion not only because it was publicly humiliating, but for the degree of suffering inflicted. With the weight of the body pulling down, breathing becomes difficult, and the condemned could hang for days, slowly suffocating."<br><br>"True, but according to accounts of the witch trials, burning was the worst way to die. If you keep the person from dying from smoke inhalation, they can live a surprisingly long time, and suffer unimaginable pain."<br><br>Brendan shivered. Okay, that went beyond morbid. Maybe these weren't mainstream religious do-gooders, but some kind of fanatical sect. Like the Scientologists or something. Most religious people he knew were good folks, but there were wackos. As much as he wanted to go home, he wouldn't put up with any kind of sick shit. He should get up, go in there, maybe tell them he'd changed his mind. But he was so tired.<br><br>The voices had stopped. Good. He'd rest for a few more minutes, then sneak out&#x2013;<br><br>The door opened. In walked the man and woman, followed by three others: a younger woman, a balding man and a white-haired one.<br><br>"Hello, Brendan," said the woman.<br><br>Brendan struggled to his feet. "I want to leave."<br><br>The woman nodded. Then she stepped forward, lifted her hand to her mouth and blew. A cloud of white dust flew into Brendan's face. He tried to cough, but only wheezed. She started speaking in Latin again and his knees gave way. The other two men rushed to grab him, each taking an arm, their grips gentle as they helped him to his feet.<br><br>The men lifted his arms around their shoulders. His eyelids flagged and closed. His feet dragged across the floor as they took him into a second, smaller room. The men exchanged words, then lowered him to the floor. A cold, hard floor.<br><br>He opened his eyes. There, from high above, a dog stared down at him. A terrier, like his sister's dog. But there was something wrong . . . <br><br>Legs. It didn't have any legs. Just a torso and a head perched on the edge of an overhang, watching him.<br><br>Hallucinating.<br><br>Drugged?<br><br>He should care&#x2013;knew he should care&#x2013;but he couldn't work up the energy. He squeezed his eyes shut and huddled there, too weak to even think. He heard them talking and he could tell they were speaking English, but deciphering the meaning of the words required too much energy, so he just listened to the sound and let it lull him.<br><br>Liquid splashed onto his back, seeping through his shirt. Cold and wet and stinking of something he should recognize. Then, as he was about to drift off, his wandering brain identified the smell.<br><br>Gasoline.<br><br>He snapped awake, panicked, telling his arms and legs to move, his mouth to scream, but nothing obeyed. He cracked open his eyes just enough to see the people filing from the room. The woman stopped in front of him and bent. Her smiling lips parted, saying something reassuring. Then she struck the match.<br><br> JAIME VEGAS, CENTER STAGE<br><br> One drawback to being onstage for most of your life is that eventually you forget how to act when you're off it. Not that it matters. In such a life, you're never really offstage. Even walking from your bedroom to the kitchen you can't lower your guard . . . at least not if you're on the set of one of the most anticipated TV specials of the season&#x2013;one costarring you.<br><br>I'd started my career at the age of three, forced onto the toddler beauty pageant catwalks by a mother who'd already decided I needed to earn my keep. I should have grown up dreaming of the day I'd be off that stage. But when I stepped into the limelight, every eye was on me and I shone. It became my refuge and now, forty years later, while there were days when I really didn't feel like strapping on four-inch heels and smiling until my jaw hurt, my heart still beat a little faster as I walked down that hall.<br><br>The buzz of a saw drowned out the clicking of my heels on the hardwood. I caught a whiff of sawdust and oil, and shuddered to imagine what alterations the crew was making to the house. From what I'd heard, the homeowners weren't likely to complain&#x2013;they desperately needed the money. The "official" rumor was a failed film project, but the one I'd heard involved an unplanned baby project with the nanny. Tabloid stories to be suppressed, a young woman to be paid off, a wife to placate&#x2013;it could all get very expensive.<br><br>As I passed a young man measuring the hall, I nodded and his jaw dropped.<br><br>"M&#x2013;Ms. Vegas? Jaime Vegas?"<br><br>I swung around and fixed him with a megawatt smile that I didn't need to fake. Shallow of me, I know, but there's no ego boost like the slack-jawed gape of a man half your age.<br><br>"Geez, it is you." He hurried over to shake my hand. "Could I&#x2013;? I know it's unprofessional to ask, but is there any chance of getting an autograph?"<br><br>"Of course. I'm heading to a meeting right now, but you can grab an autograph from me anytime. Just bring me something to sign. Or if you prefer a photo . . ."<br><br>"A photo would be great."<br><br>My smile brightened. "A photo it is, then. I have some in my room."<br><br>"Thanks. Grandpa will love it. He's such a fan of yours. He has a thing for redheads, but you're his favorite. All his buddies in the nursing home think you're hot."<br><br>Just what I needed on the first day of a big job&#x2013;the reminder that in Hollywood time, I was already a decade past my best-before date.<br><br>I kept smiling, though. Another minute of conversation, and the promise of a handful of signed photos for Gramps and the boys, and I was off again.<br><br>As I neared the dining room, I heard a crisp British voice snap, "Because it's ridiculous, that's why. Mr. Grady is a professional. He will not be subjected to mockery."<br><br>Before I pushed open the door, I pictured the speaker: a stylish woman, roughly my age, dressed in a suit and oozing efficiency. I walked in, and there she was&#x2013;short blond hair, thin lips, small and wiry, as if extra flesh would be a sign of softness she could ill afford. Icy green eyes glared from behind her tiny glasses. Personal assistant model A: the bulldog, designed to raise hell on her client's behalf, leaving him free to play the gracious, good-natured star.<br><br>Facing her was a younger woman, maybe thirty, dumpy, with a shoulder-length bob and worried eyes. Director model C: the overwhelmed first-timer.<br><br>The dining room, like most of the house, had been "redecorated" to accommodate the shoot. The homeowners had cleared out anything they didn't want damaged, so the dining set was gone, replaced by a cheaper one. As for the dead guy hanging from the chandelier, I suspected he came with the house, and was probably tough to remove without an exorcism or two.<br><br>The hanging man was maybe fifty, average size but with heavy jowls, as if he'd lost a lot of weight fast. He swayed from an old crystal chandelier, superimposed over the modern one. His face was mottled and swollen, eyes thankfully closed.<br><br>I eyed him from the doorway so I wouldn't be tempted to stare once I was in the room. After thirty years of seeing ghosts, you learn all the tricks.<br><br>This one, though, wasn't a ghost, but a residual. What tragedy had brought him to an end so emotionally powerful that the image was seared forever in this room? I doused my curiosity. It would do me no good. When you see scenes like this every day, you can't afford to stop and wonder. You just can't.<br><br>Both women turned as I entered. The assistant's gaze slid over me, lips tightening as if someone had shoved a lemon wedge in her mouth. I flashed a smile and her lips pursed more. If you can't still turn the heads of twenty-year-old boys, winning the catty disapproval of women your own age is a good consolation prize.<br><br>I stopped a hairbreadth from the hanged man and tried not to recoil as his swaying body circled my way.<br><br>"I hope I'm not interrupting," I said to the woman with the worried eyes. "I was sent to speak to the director, Becky Cheung. Would that be you?"<br><br>She smiled and extended a hand. "It is. And you must be Jaime Vegas. This is Claudia Wilson, Bradford Grady's assistant."<br><br>I shook Cheung's hand. "Should I step outside and let you two finish?"<br><br>"No, no." Desperation touched Becky's voice. "This concerns you too. We're discussing a promo shot. Mr. Simon has decided he wants the three stars to say a line."<br><br>Claudia shot a hard look at Becky. "A specific line. Tell her what it is."<br><br>"Um . . . 'I see dead people.'

No poet of his time wrote more distinctively or inventively, or with more relentless intensity. With its formal exuberance and its uncompromising, often heartbreaking expressiveness, his poetry continues to surprise and challenge.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>Kevin Young</b>&nbsp;is the author of twelve books of poetry and prose, including&nbsp;<i>Blue Laws: Selected &amp; Uncollected Poems 1995-2015</i>&nbsp;(2016), longlisted for the National Book Award;&nbsp;<i>Book of Hours</i>&nbsp;(2014), a finalist for the&nbsp;Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award&nbsp;and winner of the&nbsp;Lenore Marshall Prize for Poetry&nbsp;from the Academy of American Poets;&nbsp;<i>Ardency: A Chronicle of the Amistad Rebels</i>&nbsp;(2011), winner of an American Book Award; and&nbsp;<i>Dear Darkness</i>&nbsp;(2008).

He is&nbsp;is the Director of the&nbsp;Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and poetry editor of <i>The New Yorker</i>.John Berryman (1914-72) has one of the most idiosyncratic voices in American poetry. That voice, which is everywhere on display in a new Selected Poems, capably edited by Kevin Young, is by turns quirky and whimsical, brilliantly learned and painfully mannered, smart-alecky, anguished. Berryman combined a passionate, disruptive syntax with an irreverent blend of highbrow and lowbrow dictions -- part Shakespeare, part minstrel show, part baby talk. Who could have predicted such a salty, ostentatious and exaggerated comic style -- or known that it would come to seem so intensely literary and inevitably American? Imagine Emily Dickinson crossed with Bessie Smith and Groucho Marx. The results, to use one of Berryman's favorite words, are "delicious."<p> No significant American poet is funnier, though the comedy is nervous and limned with sadness. ("Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so.") When I was in school my friends and I followed the antic doings of the ironic hero of The Dream Songs -- huffy, unappeasable Henry ("an old Pussycat," "a human American man") -- the way popular culture addicts followed the soaps, episode by episode. We were amazed by the way that "Homage to Mistress Bradstreet" created an imaginary dialogue between two poets across the centuries. Who else would have turned to a Puritan writer he was summoning out of the past and declared, "I want to take you for my lover"? We didn't yet recognize the dark truth of Berryman's underlying subject, which was, as he said, "the almost insuperable difficulty of writing high verse in a land that cared and cares so little for it."</p><p> We were stunned, too, by Berryman's Sonnets, which showed the poet under obsessive emotional pressure "crumpling a syntax with a sudden need." The critics pasted Love &amp; Fame and Delusions, etc., but we regaled one another with "It is supernal what a youth can take" and "All the black same I dance my blue head off." We applauded when he fought back with "Defensio in Extremis":</p><p>I said: Mighty men have encamped against me, <br>and they have questioned not only the skill of my defences <br>but my sincerity.<br>Now, Father, let them have it.</p><p>In his last books Berryman spoke with unadorned directness and a certain exhibitionist glee in his wayward past. He wrote religious poems, such as "Eleven Addresses to the Lord" and "Opus Dei," in which he put himself "under new management" by embracing a "God of rescue." One felt him standing, guilt-ridden and amazed, before the eternal.</p><p>He also wrote needy, grief-stricken poems that one still returns to late at night. Such lyrics as "He Resigns," "Henry by Night," and "Henry's Understanding" have a terrifying clarity and simplicity. They have a dark vulnerability and honesty, a wounded splendor.</p><p>Henry's Understanding</p><p>He was reading late, at Richard's, down in Maine, <br>aged 32? Richard &amp; Helen long in bed, <br>my good wife long in bed.<br>All I had to do was strip &amp; get into my bed, <br>putting the marker in the book, &amp; sleep, <br>&amp; wake to a hot breakfast.<br>Off the coast was an island, P'tit Manaan, <br>the bluff from Richard's lawn was almost sheer.<br>A chill at four o'clock.<br>It only takes a few minutes to make a man.<br>A concentration upon now &amp; here.<br>Suddenly, unlike Bach, <br>&amp; horribly, unlike Bach, it occurred to me <br>that one night, instead of warm pajamas, <br>I'd take off all my clothes <br>&amp; cross the damp cold lawn &amp; down the bluff <br>into the terrible water &amp; walk forever <br>under it out toward the island.</p><p>By Edward Hirsch <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

As the central force of sanity, he conquers all his enemies, the evil forces of the four directions, who turn people's minds away from the true teachings of Buddhism. These enemies graphically represent the different manifestations of cowardly mind. <br><br>As Ch�gyam Trungpa explains in the Foreword: <br><br>"When we talk here about conquering our enemy, it is important to understand that we are not talking about aggression. The genuine warrior does not become resentful or arrogant . . . It is absolutely necessary for the warrior to subjugate his own ambition to conquer at the same time that he is subjugating his other more obvious enemies. Thus the idea of warriorship altogether is that by facing all our enemies fearlessly, with gentleness and intelligence, we can develop ourselves thereby attaining self-realization." <br><br>The legends of Gesar usually take weeks for a bard to recount.

Now, using never-before-published quotes taken from his in-depth interviews with twenty-three of the twenty-four Apollo lunar astronauts, Chaikin and his collaborator, Victoria Kohl, have created an extraordinary account of the lunar missions. In <i>Voices from the Moon</i> the astronauts vividly recount their experiences in intimate detail; their distinct personalities and remarkably varied perspectives emerge from their candid and deeply personal reflections. Carefully assembled into a narrative that reflects the entire arc of the lunar journey, <i>Voices from the Moon</i> captures the magnificence of the Apollo program like no other book. Paired with their own words are 160 images taken from NASA's new high-resolution scans of the photos the astronauts took during the missions. Many of the photos, which are reproduced with stunning and unprecedented detail, have rarely-if ever-been seen by the general public. <i>Voices from the Moon</i> is an utterly unique chronicle of these defining moments in human history.</p><p>Andrew Chaikin is the author of the acclaimed <i>A Man on the Moon</i> and several other books about space.

Wonderment.</p><b><p>&#x2014;FRANK BORMAN</p></b><p>It's a little different sitting in the rocket, rather than watching it... from the ground, and hearing the announcer, you know, dramaticallytalk about the countdown, and what's going on. Insidethe rocket, sitting there, waiting for the countdown, is a lot different,because you don't get that momentous buildup, that anxietybuildup. You're sitting there, and you just do certain things. And thelaunch is a little bit different too, because on the ground you getthat vibration in your stomach, whereas in the spacecraft itself, it'sa big rumble. You can hear those valves open up and all that fueldrop down those manifold valves. You know, the pipes are big. Youknow, you're burning fifteen tons per second. And so you really goto town, and you can hear that. And it's a big rumbling noise, andoff you go.</p><b><p>&#x2014;JIM LOVELL</p></b><p>There's always the element of unreality in it because a launch is notreal until you lift off.

So you don'tcommit yourself to the flight&#x2014;totally&#x2014;until you get ignition andyou're off the pad. And then, it's all or nothing. That's the gamble&#x2014;it's either heads or tails.

Drawing on the latest neuroscience and behavioral research, Dr. Kang shows why pushy, hovering "tiger parents" and permissive "jellyfish parents" actually hinder self-motivation. She proposes a powerful new parenting model: the intelligent, joyful, highly social dolphin. Dolphin parents focus on maintaining balance in their children's lives to compassionately yet authoritatively guide them toward lasting health, happiness, and success.<br><br> The mother of three children and the daughter of immigrant parents who struggled to give their children the "best" in life&#x2014;Dr. Kang's mother could not read, her father taught her math while they drove around in his taxicab, and she was never enrolled in a single extracurricular activity&#x2014;Dr. Kang argues that often the simplest "benefits" parents give their children are the most valuable. Combining irrefutable science with unforgettable real-life stories, <i>The Self-Motivated Kid</i> walks readers through Dr. Kang's four-part method for cultivating self-motivation. She argues that by trusting our deepest intuition about what is best for our kids, we will allow them to develop key traits&#x2014;adaptability, community-mindedness, creativity, and critical thinking&#x2014;to empower them to succeed and thrive in our increasingly competitive and complex world.</p><p><b>Shimi Kang, M.D.,</b> is a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, medical director for Child and Youth Mental Health for Vancouver, and clinical associate professor at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Kang has helped thousands of children, adolescents, and parents across North America, Europe, and Asia move toward positive behaviors and better mental health.&#x201c;What a wonderful contribution to the emerging evolution of conscious parenting! An encyclopedia of research and insights to help parents navigate their parenting journeys!&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Dr. Shefali Tsabary, author of <i>The Conscious Parent</i> and <i>Out of Control</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The perception of today&#x2019;s parents as micro�managers who steal all the oxygen is often correct, and as the research trickles in, we are seeing a generation of kids who are lacking internal control. Award-winning physician Kang shows parents how these kids&#x2014;likened to tiger cubs&#x2014;are 'increasingly dependent on external rewards to stay motivated' and how parents are turning their cubs into the 'overworked, middle-aged.' Kang views this tiger style as 'under parenting' that includes too much 'pushing, pulling, directing, instructing, scheduling, and monitoring.' Seeking to right the scales, the author shows parents how to develop skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration&#x2014;what she calls the CQ, or cognitive quotient. By encouraging parents to model dolphins, who instruct by play, exploration, social bonds, altruism, contribution, and family and community values, kids will strengthen their own internal compass and have a stronger core with a greater chance at personal success and happiness. Combining scientific research with personal stories, Kang has a soothing and encouraging tone that will appeal to many readers.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Library Journal (STARRED REVIEW)</b><br><br> &#x201c;With&nbsp;insight, professional expertise and unfailing instinct, Dr. Shimi Kang&nbsp;provides essential guidance in restoring sanity to 21st Century parenting.

She is the author of <i>Holy Listening: The Art of Spiritual Direction</i>.Toward Holy Ground is filled with personal insights and experience, as well as intellectual and spiritual dimensions. Guenther takes the reader on a journey through life &#x2013; all phases of life, and brings us lovingly to the latter years, complete with a carefully selected saint to share in the adventure! The author takes us from holy ground to kingships, healing, wholeness, and harvest, and finally a good death. There is a deepening of faith and compassion as this reviewer read and re-read the pages. When she ends the book with the chapter, &#x2018;Ministering with the Aging' (note that it is ministering WITH), I felt that every lay person and priest of the Episcopal Church should read this chapter as a requirement for ministry at any age... Of the many books I have read over the years dealing with the aging process in the journey of life, this book was one I could not put down, made complete sense for lay and clergy alike, enriched my own spirituality and sense of mission &#x2013; and was a pilgrimage of renewed ministry. Don't fail to read this one! (Douglas G. Carner, President ESMA board of directors)<br><br>Written by a priest who is professor of ascetical theology at General Theological Seminary, this is a book for those of any age ready to order their loves &#x2013; a phrase that struck me as so utterly simple yet essential &#x2013; and to shape their lives in order to live generously and passionately. <i>Toward Holy Ground</i> is &#x2018;concerned with how we live out our professed beliefs, how we sanctify the ordinary, how we cultivate awareness of God in the small and everyday.' And it is wonderful to read! I particularly enjoyed Guenther's skill in connecting Bible stories to daily life and her frequent referral to the apocryphal St. Anne, revered for centuries as God's grandmother, and that Holy Kinship which provided a rich, crowded family life for Jesus. The author's nitty-gritty on developing a rule of life and a rule of play is at once practical and encouraging. I highly recommend Toward Holy Ground for anyone moving toward spiritual direction and discipline and for all others who enjoy a well-written book that helps one take a step further into the faith.

Selected by Tyehimba Jess as a National Poetry Series winner.</b><br><br>In this provocative collection by award-winning poet and artist Dominique Christina, the historical life of Anarcha is personally reenvisioned. Anarcha was an enslaved Black woman who endured experimentation and torture at the hands of Dr. Marion Sims, more commonly known as the father of modern gynecology. Christina enables Anarcha to tell her story without being relegated to the margins of history, as a footnote to Dr. Sims&#x2019;s life.

Weaving first-person accounts with original research, Vietnam War scholar Fred A. Wilcox examines long-term consequences for future generations, laying bare the ongoing monumental tragedy in Vietnam, and calls for the United States government to finally admit its role in chemical warfare in Vietnam. Wilcox also warns readers that unless we stop poisoning our air, food, and water supplies, the cancer epidemic in the United States and other countries will only worsen, and he urgently demands the chemical manufacturers of Agent Orange to compensate the victims of their greed and to stop using the Earth&#x2019;s rivers, lakes, and oceans as toxic waste dumps. Vietnam has chosen August 10&#x2014;the day that the US began spraying Agent Orange on Vietnam&#x2014;as Agent Orange Day, to commemorate all its citizens who were affected by the deadly chemical. Scorched Earth will be released upon the third anniversary of this day, in honor of all those whose families have suffered, and continue to suffer, from this tragedy.</p><p><p><b>FRED A.

He was a leader, a thinker, a Torah and Talmud commentator, a halachic decisor, a successful defender of Judaism against the Church and its Jewish apostates. At the age of 70 he was exiled from his native Aragon, and during the next three years, he wrote the monumental Chumash commentary that has stood the test of over six centuries. Unexcelled in depth, breadth, scope, and profundity, Ramban&#39;s comprehensive commentary is exceedingly brilliant, exceedingly seminal - and exceedingly complex. Few are those who have mastered this masterpiece. Now, thanks to a superb group of exceptional scholars, writers, and editors, Ramban&#39;s Chumash commentary is coming alive in English for everyone. Following the renowned pattern of the magnificent Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud and the Sapirstein Edition of Rashi, this classic commentary is presented with unprecedented clarity. No effort has been spared to make this new Chumash clear, accurate, and &#34;user-friendly&#34;. In short, this treatment of Chumash-Ramban will be the last word for generations to come. When completed, it will be eight volumes of excellence. This historic project will be a momentous breakthrough in Torah literature. Enjoy the richness of Ramban&#39;s commentary and see your understanding of the Torah grow as you never imagined it could.</p><p></p><h2>Our Cosmic Ancestry in the Stars: The Panspermia Revolution and the Origins of Humanity</h2><p>An exploration of how acceptance of panspermia will soon change history <br><br>� Offers extensive scientific proof of panspermia--that life arose on Earth via comets and that evolution is seeded by viruses arriving via comets and interstellar dust <br><br>� Explores the major philosophical, psychological, cultural, religious, and environmental ramifications of the acceptance of this new scientific worldview <br><br>Mainstream consensus is that life arose on Earth spontaneously out of &#x201c;primordial soup.&#x201d; Yet this theory, as well as the Darwinian &#x201c;survival of the fittest&#x201d; concept as it relates to major steps in evolution, has no scientific basis or proof. Where, then, did life come from? As the authors show, with conclusive scientific evidence, life came from space--a concept known as &#x201c;panspermia.&#x201d; We humans, and all other life on Earth, evolved over millennia in response to viruses that arrived via comets, and we continue to do so. <br><br>Exploring the philosophical, psychological, cultural, and environmental ramifications of the acceptance of panspermia, the authors show how the shift will be on par with the Copernican Revolution--when it was finally accepted that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. Explaining the origins of the panspermia theory in the work of the late Sir Fred Hoyle, the authors reveal the vast body of evidence that has accumulated over the past 4 decades in favor of the cosmic origins of life, including viral inserts found in DNA that have shaped our human genome over millions of years. They show how the tiniest of viruses, microscopic animals (tardigrades), and even seeds have been found to be natural cosmonauts. The authors also show how space-borne viruses play a crucial role in the positive evolution of life and that our entire existence on this planet is contingent on the continuing ingress of cosmic viruses. <br><br>Revealing how panspermia offers answers to some of humanity&#x2019;s longstanding questions about the origins of life, the authors discuss the impact this shift in understanding will have on our relationship with the Earth and on culture, history, and religion. And perhaps the most dramatic ramification of all is that acceptance of panspermia means acceptance that Earth is not unique--that other life-filled planets exist and intelligent life is common in the Universe. Not only did we come from space, but we are not alone.</p><p>Chandra Wickramasinghe, Ph.D., is the director of the Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Buckingham.

These are the deepest of philosophical questions and perhaps the very first that were asked as soon as <i>Homo sapiens</i> acquired the intellectual capacity to do so. The first answers, as far as we can glean from surviving fragmentary evidence--folklore and cave art--invariably turned to the skies. The spectacle of the Milky Way must surely have overwhelmed our ancestors, as indeed it overwhelms us today. This sense of awe may have led directly to the concept of the sun god and other gods, all of whom were placed in the skies. The Humans--<i>Homo sapiens</i>--were still helpless creatures beholden and subservient to the inexorable power of the universe. The harsh vicissitudes of nature--droughts, floods, storms at sea, earthquakes--all contributed to enslave and humiliate them. They needed the gods of the heavens to provide comfort, solace, and safe passage through the journey of life. <br><br>Humankind&#x2019;s subservience to Nature has found expression in art from the earliest cave paintings to modern times. With advances in technology some of the cruelest forces of nature were tamed. Civilization marched forward and our ancestors began to feel they were more and more in control of their destiny. Control appeared to shift from the universe with its capricious ever-changing patterns to the fixed Earth, which was deemed constant, eternal, and largely under human control. <br><br>We realize now, or at least we should have realized, that our entire genetic heritage (except for minor tweakings) came from the vast external universe. Earth was just an insignificant building site upon which the blueprint of all life came to be assembled into a great multitude of different forms. Throughout the universe there are countless other building sites, more or less like the Earth, on which the same process must have occurred. So the humbling realization is that we humans, and indeed all other life on Earth, are utterly unimportant in the wider cosmic context. <br><br>One of the most exciting areas of modern astronomy is the search for planets orbiting distant stars--planets that are habitable and more or less similar to Earth. Many studies directed at such searches are presently underway deploying telescopes that are in orbit around the Earth. The currently estimated tally of Earth-like planets runs to over a hundred billion in our galaxy alone--averaging about one &#x201c;Earth&#x201d; for every sun-like star. The implication is that the average separation between two Earth-like planets is a mere four light years. This incredibly short distance in cosmic terms clearly implies that exchanges of bacteria and viruses between such planets is not only <i>possible</i>, but <i>inevitable</i>. Very recently astronomers have detected evidence for a rocky planet like Earth orbiting our nearest neighboring star Proxima Centauri. This star with its Earth-twin is only 3.1 light years away--a spitting distance from us in cosmic terms. Living material in the form of bacteria and viruses that reached Earth over the past four billion years must surely have reached the planet around Proxima Centauri as well. Life very similar to Earthlife may well have flourished there, from cosmic genetic building blocks. <br><br>Evidence for the most ancient bacterial life on Earth has recently been discovered in the form of carbon globules trapped within crystals of the mineral zircon deposited in rocks that formed 4.1 to 4.2 billion years ago during the so-called Hadean epoch. At this time the Earth was being relentlessly bombarded by comets, the same comets that also brought water to form the Earth&#x2019;s oceans. It is reasonable to infer that the same impacting comets also delivered the first life to our planet in the form of bacteria and viruses. Thereafter the addition of viruses from comets expanded the genomes of evolving life on the Earth. One dramatic event 540 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion of multi-celled life, is now known to have brought essentially all the genes that were needed to generate the entire range of evolutionary development witnessed in the record of life on the Earth. <br><br>We have noted that the information content of life at the molecular level is of a superastronomical magnitude. The logical conclusion is that this crucial information for life&#x2019;s origin and evolution is always present in the Universe, and that genes carrying such information are continually amplified and distributed through the agency of comets. Bacterial and viral genes delivered to the Earth are continually being added to genomes of evolving life-forms. Major evolutionary traits in the development of complex life are all externally derived, and evolution itself is a process that is essentially driven from outside. If this is the case, the overall impression will be of a pre-programming leading to the higher levels of development in biology. Even some less definable manifestations of gene expression in our own hominid line of descent, for example the emergence of genes for higher levels of cognition, bear the signs of &#x201c;pre-programming&#x201d; or pre-evolution. <br><br>We now know that impacts of asteroids and comets on planets laden with life can not only cause extinctions of species (e.g. the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago) but also cause the splash back of life-laden material (dust and meteorites) that can reach neighboring planets. We can argue that Darwinian-style evolution occurred not on any one planet like Earth but was spread over innumerable habitats in the grandest possible cosmic setting. Whatever happened, it is clear that life cannot be regarded as unique or confined to the Earth. Life on Earth implies life everywhere. It follows that life of all the types and forms known on Earth, ranging from bacteria to plants, animals, and even intelligent life must, to a high degree of probability, be all-pervasive. This is now not just a theory but an inescapable fact.</p><h2>Tales of the Tikongs</h2><p>In this lively satire of contemporary South Pacific life, we meet a familiar cast of characters: multinational experts, religious fanatics, con men, "simple" villagers, corrupt politicians. In writing about this tiny world of flawed personalities, Hau&#x2018;ofa displays his wit and range of comic resource, amply exercising what one reviewer called his &#x201c;gift of seeing absurdity clearly."</p><p>Tiko, a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean, faces a tidal wave of D-E-V-E-L-O-P-M-E-N-T, which threatens to demolish ancestral ways and the human spirit. From Sione, who prefers to play cards with his secretary during work hours, to Ole Pasifikiwei, who masters the twists and turns of international funding games, all of the characters in these pages are seasoned surfers, capable of riding the biggest wave to shore. These are not stories of fatal impact so much as upbeat tales of indigenous responses to cultural and economic imperialism. Epeli Hauofa uses devices derived from oral storytelling to create a South Pacific voice that is lucid, hilarious, and compassionate in a work that has long been regarded as a milestone in Pacific literature.<b>Epeli Hau&#x2018;ofa</b> (1939&#x2013;2009) was born in Papua New Guinea and educated in Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Fiji, Australia, and Canada. He worked at the University of the South Pacific&#x2019;s main campus in Suva, Fiji, where he was the founder and director of the Oceania Centre for Arts and Culture, established in 1997.</p><h2>Summer, 1945: Germany, Japan and the Harvest of Hate</h2><p>&#34;We Americans have the dangerous tendency in our international thinking to take a holier-than-thou attitude toward other nations. We consider ourselves to be more noble and decent than other peoples, and consequently in a better position to decide what is right and wrong in the world. What kind of war do civilians suppose we fought, anyway? We shot prisoners in cold blood, wiped out hospitals, strafed lifeboats, killed or mistreated enemy civilians, finished off the enemy wounded, tossed the dying into a hole with the dead, and in the Pacific boiled the flesh off enemy skulls to make table ornaments for sweethearts, or carved their bones into letter openers.... [W]e mutilated the bodies of enemy dead, cutting off their ears and kicking out their gold teeth for souvenirs, and buried them with their testicles in their mouths.... We topped off our saturation bombing and burning of enemy civilians by dropping atomic bombs on two nearly defenseless cities, thereby setting an all-time record for instantaneous mass slaughter. As victors we are privileged to try our defeated opponents for their crimes against humanity; but we should be realistic enough to appreciate that if we were on trial for breaking international laws, we should be found guilty on a dozen counts. We fought a dishonorable war, because morality had a low priority in battle. The tougher the fighting, the less room for decency, and in Pacific contests we saw mankind reach the blackest depths of bestiality.&#34; ---- Edgar Jones, WWII Veteran</p><p>Thomas Goodrich is a professional writer living on the Gulf Coast of Florida.

He knew only that he had to civilize her, present her at court, and Almack's, and then marry her off to the highest bidder.

Lady Peterborough begged.&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has already been scandal enough to keep tongues wagging for three lifetimes."<br><br>Denbigh glanced up, square into the gawking face of Lady Hornby, a notorious gossip.&nbsp;&nbsp;That flustered lady quickly hid her face behind an ivory fan, but as Denbigh's narrowed eyes scoured the pews, he found as many smirks as he did expressions of sympathy.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had never considered himself a proud man, but he was a private one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today his pain and humiliation had been laid bare for the town.<br><br>He felt cold, as though his warm, pulsating heart had ceased pumping blood to his extremities.&nbsp;&nbsp;He hardly noticed Percy ushering all of them into a nearby room used by the clergy.&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw, as from a distance, Percy retrieve the crumpled note from his father and spread it out to read what it contained.<br><br>"She does not say where she is going, precisely," Percy announced.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only that she is going somewhere she cannot be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that she is sorry for any pain she has caused."<br><br>"I have to find her," Denbigh said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must speak with her."<br><br>"I would not advise it, my friend," Percy said gently.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing good can come of such an interview."<br><br>"I don't care!"

In Southern California in the early 70s, she continued in the battle for gay civil rights and helped to organize the takeover of &#34;The Ladies&#39; Home Journal&#34; and &#34;ogle-in&#34; - where women staked out Wall Street and whistled at the men.</p><p>Lesbian scholar and activist Karla Jay's memoir is rich in sexual detail and family trauma, but may be enjoyed best as a personal history of the turbulent era in which its author came of age. She brings fresh first-hand reports on some of the most pivotal events in the rise of the New Left--from the 1968 student riots at Columbia through the Stonewall riots to the 1970 feminist takeover of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, which Jay describes as "without a doubt the most successful one-day action taken by the Women's Liberation Movement."<p> At times nostalgic, at other times clear-eyed and critical, Jay recounts her close involvement with both the Gay Liberation Front and radical feminist groups. In an atmosphere of increasing paranoia (Jay's own phone was tapped, and there is evidence of FBI infiltration of the meetings she attended), she came to terms "with the likelihood that I would spend some part of my life in prison." Enlivened, here and there, by waspish recollections of Rita Mae Brown and other activists, Jay's memoir takes its place beside Jan Clausen's recent <i>Apples and Oranges</i> in tracking the inception of the gay rights movement and the glory days of women's lib. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p><b>Karla Jay</b> is Professor of English and Director of Women's Studies at Pace Unviersity.

Sounding out the nerves and nodes of language to transform "every burn-mark and blemish," to "bind our river-wrack and leavings," Romey seeks to forge finally (if even for a moment) a chord in which he might live. Intently visceral, aural, oral, Atsuro Riley's poems bristle with musical and imaginative pleasures, with story-telling and picture-making of a new and wholly unexpected kind.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;"Atsuro Riley's astonishing and original debut collection, <i>Romey's Order</i>, thrives off its music. The poems are about the attempt to make sense of the world, to account for all the strange and disparate details that enthrall consciousness, and to hold them in some kind of right relation. . . There's a lot to marvel at here. . .The tension between the world of fact into which each of us is born and the desire to forge our own new worlds results here in beguiling music, a music that brings these poems alive, with all their sinew and subtlety." --Peter Campion, <i>Poetry</i><br> <i></i><br> <br> Atsuro Riley's indelible first-book masterpiece--opens with "Once upon a time," and thereafter an entire world emerges. . . &nbsp;<i>Romey's Order</i> presents a world teeming with mystery, natural wonder, childhood discovery, and--everywhere under the surface--the secret, almost magical power of language. Throughout the book, Riley's evocative abilities are flat-out astonishing.<br> The handcrafted poems of <i>Romey's Order</i> bear the mark of a fully developed, highly idiosyncratic sensibility--a sensibility that lends a from-out-of-nowhere quality to this collection, and that results in poems that are a pure delight to read. Riley's debut is a blast of fresh air for poetry, leaving one with the almost unsettling question: what would happen if his next collection outdid this one?<br> --<i>The Believer</i> magazine, May 2011&nbsp; &nbsp; (<i>The Believer</i> Poetry Award citation)<br>"Atsuro Riley's <i>Romey's Order</i> is a dazzling first book. . . among the year's best. . .The lexical fireworks power the narrative with physicality.&nbsp; The pleasures of <i>Romey's Order</i> are wondrous and manifold."--<i>Dallas Morning News</i><br> <br> "One of the most exciting and distinctive debut collections in years&nbsp;. .&nbsp;the relation of language to the actual experience of perception is 100 percent pitch-perfect here."--<i>The Believer</i><br> <br> "A stunning first book of poems. . . . Even read silently, Mr. Riley's delicious words roll and roil in the mouth."--<i>New York Times</i><br> <b><i></i></b><br> "Originality is easier said than done. Most works of art, like most consumer goods, are versions or outright imitations. In contemporary poetry, even the so-called experimental often seems derivative and weighted with conventions. But when a new book of poems is as different from precedents as Atsuro Riley's <i>Romey's Order</i>, readers should take special notice."--<i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i><br> <br> "Atsuro Riley's <i>Romey's Order</i> is a first book with rare, powerful distinction--experimental in its forms and syntax, yet familiar as an old-time fiddle for its Appalachian twang, landscape, and imagery."&nbsp;--<i>Kenyon Review</i><br> <br> "Atsuro Riley's strange, beautiful and unsettling debut is like nothing else you will read this year."--<i>Hudson Review</i></p><p>"The best literature forces you out of your old eyes and that's what happens here. Atsuro Riley's<i>&nbsp;Romey's Order&nbsp;is deep craft--brilliant and consuming and thoroughly strange. When you put this book down, American poetry will be different than when you picked it up."</i><i></i><i>--Kay Ryan, United States Poet Laureate, 2008-10<br><br>"<i>Romey's Order&nbsp;is the world of a young boy growing up in backwoods South Carolina.&nbsp; His father is an ex-soldier, his mother the Japanese wife the father brought home from his time as a soldier. Thus the radical dichotomies in the young boy's world, rendered in a dense and beautiful, intensely expressive and inventive language. This language is indebted to Hopkins as well as Heaney, full of a child's invented word-play trying to capture the smells and textures and country-speech he is constantly assaulted by. The boy is obsessed with language, words that save the dense world from extinction. Words confer almost a magical immediacy to experience, but also wound: half-Asian, at the fair he finds a stall with a game called 'Shoot the Gook Down.' The author frames all this as his heritage: 'This is the house . . . I come from and carry.'&nbsp; The result is amazing and indelible, a brilliant work." &nbsp;</i><i>--Frank Bidart<br><br>"<i>Romey's Order&nbsp;will draw you in and forward from the moment you enter its compelling initial image: an enchanted cave of a ditch pipe. The poems are pure joy on the level of the syllable, pure music on the level of the phrase, and pure integrity on the level of the form: a 'pure product of America'--yet one that is sanely exuberant, as real to the touch as a barbed wire fence and as tender to the mind as a willow."</i><i>--Susan Stewart</i><i><br>"Atsuro Riley's astonishing and original debut collection,&nbsp;Romey's Order, thrives off its music.

Roosevelt introduced Social Security to the American people, he described it as &#x201c;a return to values lost in the course of our economic development and expansion.&#x201d; A return to values indeed. Our Social Security system, which celebrates its 80th birthday this year, was founded in the 20th century, yet the concept of a national program of Social Security benefits dates back to the founding of the nation. Founding Father Thomas Paine published his pamphlet, Agrarian Justice, in 1797. There, Paine proposed old-age and disability benefits, funded by a tax on estates. In Agrarian Justice, Paine makes the compelling case that the fruits of our great wealth and productivity are most beneficial when they are used to support economic security and dignity for all Americans. This new edition of Agrarian Justice includes a Foreword by best-selling author and Social Security expert Nancy Altman. The Foreword highlights how Social Security embodies the values animating our nation's founding and the ideas set forth by Founding Father Thomas Paine in Agrarian Justice.</p><p></p><h2>Hazards of Time Travel: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>An ingenious, dystopian novel of one young woman&#x2019;s resistance against the constraints of an oppressive society, from the inventive imagination of Joyce Carol Oates</strong> </p><p>&#x201c;Time travel&#x201d; &#x2014; and its hazards&#x2014;are made literal in this astonishing new novel in which a recklessly idealistic girl dares to test the perimeters of her tightly controlled (future) world and is punished by being sent back in time to a region of North America &#x2014; &#x201c;Wainscotia, Wisconsin&#x201d;&#x2014;that existed eighty years before. &nbsp;Cast adrift in time in this idyllic Midwestern town she is set upon a course of &#x201c;rehabilitation&#x201d;&#x2014;but cannot resist falling in love with a fellow exile and questioning&nbsp;the constrains of the Wainscotia world with results that are both devastating and liberating. &nbsp;</p><p>Arresting and visionary, <em>Hazards of Time Travel </em>&nbsp;is both a novel of harrowing discovery and an exquisitely wrought love story that may be Joyce Carol Oates&#x2019;s most unexpected novel so far.</p></p><p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is a recipient of the National Medal of Humanities, the National Book Critics Circle Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award, the National Book Award, and the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in Short Fiction, and has been several times nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.

I&#x2019;ve watched what has seemed to me to be a rather steady decline in both public and private morals, and a growing confusion about ethics.

Tracing the robust development of advertising, marketing, and public relations within the medical profession and the vast realm we now think of as "health care," Tomes considers what it means to be a "good" patient. As she shows, this history of the coevolution of medicine and consumer culture tells us much about our current predicament over health care in the United States. Understanding where the shopping model came from, why it was so long resisted in medicine, and why it finally triumphed in the late twentieth century helps explain why, despite striking changes that seem to empower patients, so many Americans remain unhappy and confused about their status as patients today.<br><br></p><p>Nancy Tomes is professor of history at Stony Brook University and author of <i>The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women, and the Microbe in American Life</i>.A superb book!&nbsp; By closely looking at the business of the doctor's office and the drug store over the twentieth century, Nancy Tomes shows how American medicine has become what it is today and why, despite a century of reforms made in the patient's interest, patients now constantly sign consent forms and still wish their doctors talked to them more. <i>Remaking the American Patient</i> is beautifully written and essential to understanding the current predicament of medical care in America.--Leslie J.

Shuttlesworth took it as a sign that God would protect him on the mission that had made him a target that night. Standing in front of his demolished home, Shuttlesworth vigorously renewed his commitment to integrate Birmingham's buses, lunch counters, police force, and parks. The incident transformed him, in the eyes of Birmingham's blacks, from an up-and-coming young minister to a virtual folk hero and, in the view of white Birmingham, from obscurity to rabble-rouser extraordinaire.</p><p>From his 1956 founding of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights through the historic demonstrations of 1963, driven by a sense of divine mission, Shuttlesworth pressured Jim Crow restrictions in Birmingham with radically confrontational acts of courage. His intensive campaign pitted him against the staunchly segregationist police commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor and ultimately brought him to the side of Martin Luther King Jr. and to the inner chambers of the Kennedy White House.</p><p>First published in 1999, Andrew Manis's award-winning biography of "one of the nation's most courageous freedom fighters" demonstrates compellingly that Shuttleworth's brand of fiery, outspoken confrontation derived from his prophetic understanding of the pastoral role. Civil rights activism was tantamount to salvation in his understanding of the role of Christian minister.</p><br></p><p>Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. are the most well known figures of the civil rights movement that emerged in Birmingham, Alabama, in the 1950s, but in Andrew M. Manis's well-documented book, the contributions of the fiery Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, founder of the Alabama Movement for Human Rights, finally come to light. Manis paints a portrait of a God-fearing (but otherwise fearless) preacher cut in the mold of rebel slave leader Nat Turner, whose lawsuits, sit-ins of train and bus stations, and defiant pulpit orations helped tear down segregation in the South. But the reverend always had a firm sense of community: "Shuttlesworth conducted his civil rights activities with his hands still tightly grasping the pastoral reins of his local church," Manis writes. "His concern for social justice was central to his 'care of souls' and prophetic proclamation." Manis also shows the reader the professional and personal costs of Shuttlesworth's activities, from the 1956 bombing of his home to the constant tension with more conservative religious leaders in a community that considered his activism dangerous. In the end, however, Shuttlesworth's deeds earned him the praise of Birmingham's citizens, the beneficiaries of his courageous campaigns for equality. <i>A Fire You Can't Put Out</i> is a blazing blueprint pointing the way for future generations of activists to continue the struggle. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i><p><b>Andrew M.

Bush, his war council, and allies launched a preemptive attack to topple Saddam Hussein and occupy Iraq. Bob Woodward's latest landmark account of Washington decision making provides an original, authoritative narrative of behind-the-scenes maneuvering over two years, examining the causes and consequences of the most controversial war since Vietnam. <br> Based on interviews with 75 key participants and more than three and a half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, <i>Plan of Attack</i> is part presidential history charting the decisions made during 16 critical months; part military history revealing precise details and the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword Polo Step; and part a harrowing spy story as the CIA dispatches a covert paramilitary team into northern Iraq six months before the start of the war. This team recruited 87 Iraqi spies designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6,000 men in Saddam Hussein's personal security organization. <br> What emerges are astonishingly intimate portraits: President Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room and the Oval Office, and in private conversation; Dick Cheney, the focused and driven vice president; Colin Powell, the conflicted and cautious secretary of state; Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat; George Tenet, the activist CIA director; Tommy Franks, the profane and demanding general; Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present referee and national security adviser; Karl Rove, the hands-on political strategist; other key members of the White House staff and congressional leadership; and foreign leaders ranging from British Prime Minister Blair to Russian President Putin. <br> <i>Plan of Attack</i> provides new details on the intelligence assessments of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction and the planning for the war's aftermath.</p><p>The 2003 American invasion of Iraq was contentious, not just in the arena of global public opinion, but within the tight-lipped world of the George W. Bush White House. As Bob Woodward reveals in <i>Plan of Attack</i>, Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were part of a group leading the charge to war while Secretary of State Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and others actively questioned the plan to invade a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks while war in Afghanistan was still being waged. Woodward gained extensive access to dozens of key figures and enjoyed hours of direct contact with the President himself (more time, seemingly, than former Bush administration officials Richard Clarke and Paul O'Neill claim to have had). As a result, he's able to cite the kind of gossip you won't find in a White House press release: Franks calls Pentagon official Douglas Feith "the f*cking stupidest guy on the face of the earth," Powell shares his alarm over how the cautious Cheney of the first Bush administration had transformed into a zealot, and Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar seems to enjoy significantly more entr�e and influence than most anyone would have thought. Bush is shown as a man intent on toppling Saddam Hussein in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and never really wavering in his decision despite offering hints that non-military solutions could be achieved. Light is also shed on CIA director George Tenet, who insists that the evidence that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction was "a slam dunk" only to later admit that his intelligence was flawed when months of post-war searches turned up nothing. But the book's most interesting character is Powell. A former soldier himself, who finds himself increasingly at odds with the agenda of the administration, Powell rejects evidence on WMDs that he sees as spurious but ultimately endorses the invasion effort, apparently out of duty. Upon its publication, the Bush administration roundly denied many of the accounts in the book that demonstrated conflict within their circles, poor judgment, or lousy planning, but the Bush/Cheney reelection campaign nonetheless listed <i>Plan of Attack</i> as recommended reading. And it is. It shows alarming problems in the way the war was conceived and planned, but it also demonstrates the tremendous conviction and dedication of the people who decided to carry it out. <i>--John Moe</i>Bob Woodward is an associate editor at <i>The Washington Post</i>, where he has worked for forty-seven years.

Molly Moon struggles to survive in Hardwick House, an orphanage apparently run by and for caricatures--the beastly mistress Miss Adderstone and her bad-tempered pug, the muscly Gordon Boils (who tattooed "KING GORD" on the fingers of his fists with a compass and ink), creepy Roger Fibbin with his "sharp nose and cold, spying eyes."

Scientific and Theological Portraits of Human Nature</h2><p>Winner of Prize for Outstanding Book in Theology and the Natural Sciences As science crafts increasingly detailed accounts of human nature, what has become of the soul? This collaborative project strives for greater consonance between contemporary science and Christian faith. Outstanding scholars in biology, genetics, neuroscience, cognitive science, philosophy, theology, biblical studies, and ethics join here to offer contemporary accounts of human nature consistent with Christian teaching. Their central theme is a nondualistic account of the human person that does not consider the &#34;soul&#34; an entity separable from the body; scientific statements about the physical nature of human beings are about exactly the same entity as are theological statements concerning the spiritual nature of human beings. For all those interested in fundamental questions of human identity posed by the present context, this volume will provide a fascinating and authoritative resource.</p><p>Warren S.

In her highly anticipated debut collection, FORT NOT, Emily Skillings creates an "atmosphere for encounter," akin to searching for meaning through lip-reading. We soon realize that these poems are speaking to us in tones that appear elegantly improvisational. And while the poems may "shout from the periphery," it is not without reason, but because of their desire to direct the reader to a created space&#x2014;a world that allows for "curved logic," "that dirty, off-gold color," "middle-class nausea," and "metallic power" to coexist. The mysteries here embrace a natural, physical music, pulling us into a moving current of painted images, poetic histories, and draped bodies evaporating to reveal others behind them, as quickly as they appear. <br> <br> "Although her language sometimes suggests she is from another planet, Emily Skillings knows how history happens on ours: 'There was a history there of men overtaking and rebuilding and casting to ruin, then drawing up new plans, beginning anew, hesitating, revising only to tear down and build again, and always slightly off-center.' This is about as normal as things get in this staggeringly beautiful, wildly offkilter account of daily life, or in Auden's words, 'A way of happening, a mouth.' Whatever. FORT NOT is a savagely brilliant debut."&#x2014;John Ashbery<br> <br> "Emily Skillings' beauteous first book is an instruction manual on how to live your life. What is a book when it's a blush? A dropdown etiquette c/o flowers and a way to teach yourself: how to backchannel your garden, how to be a matron of no, how to wipe your dirt on other people, how to talk nice to the Holland Tunnel, how to shake in Carpet Town, how to make your sinuses more operatic, how to surrender a glacier. With each lesson, FORT NOT brushes back our inhibitions and dismantles our intentions."&#x2014;Tan Lin<br><br> "Emily Skillings throws you a lot of curves and I like that. Her poems are actually pretty dense and then suddenly she shifts (knowingly) into a radiant simplicity. I love her trembling, and though she asks 'is trembling / always bad?' it's clear she knows it's not. Emily's just trying to make us watch better. I love this poet's compulsive sense of risk, her sense of humor. I love her dread. I love her love of detail. Her revulsion. So finally, basing this opinion on my exploration of this one writer, I'll say that bitches are smart. Emily Skillings is very special.

He is the author of seven other books.</p><p><b> Chapter 9:<br> New Fridge Syndrome </b></p><p> Kenny Gluck knew something was up when he saw a car slide out from the roadside to block the convoy he was traveling in. "We had left the hospital in four vehicles, and we hadn't even gotten out of the town yet when two cars cut us off -- one in the front, one in the back -- and a bunch of people in masks and carrying Kalashnikovs got out." The men opened fire, but no one was hit -- their goal wasn't to kill but to scare. "And they succeeded," Gluck says dryly. "They pulled me out of our car and pushed me into theirs. They whacked me over the head with a rifle butt and then put a coat over my head so I couldn't see." </p><p> It was January 9, 2001, and Gluck, 38 at the time, was MSF-Holland's head of mission for the North Caucasus, which includes war-torn Chechnya. On the day he was abducted, Gluck was leaving the town of Stariye Atagi, about 12 miles from the Chechen capital of Grozny. It's an area he knows well, having worked in Chechnya from 1994 to 1996 with another NGO, and since early 2000 with MSF. He's fluent in Russian, too, though it didn't help him that day in the kidnappers' car. "They didn't say anything except, 'Shut up and keep your head down.' We drove for about an hour, switched cars, then they put me in a house where we waited for a while." Gluck was moved three times that first night, before being forced into the root cellar of another house. The floorboards were just a few feet above him, making it difficult to sit up. Onions, cabbages and carrots lay on the rocky dirt floor, along with a mattress that would be Gluck's bed for the next nine nights. </p><p> Kidnapping is something of a national pastime in Chechnya, and expats are not exempt from the violence. In 1995, veteran aid worker Fred Cuny visited Chechnya on behalf of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, only to disappear in April. It's assumed he was murdered, along with three colleagues, though their bodies have never been found. The following year, six Red Cross workers -- four Europeans, a Canadian and a New Zealander -- were sleeping in their hospital compound, not far from where Gluck was abducted, when they were executed by masked men carrying guns fitted with silencers. Then Camilla Carr and Jon James, British psychologists working with a small Quaker NGO, were abducted in July 1997 and held for 14 months. By the time Carr and James were released, MSF had pulled out of Chechnya because of the insecurity, but by February 2000 they were back. And so were the kidnappings -- that August three more Red Cross workers were abducted, though they were released after a week. In all, at least 50 humanitarian aid workers have been kidnapped in the North Caucasus since 1996. </p><p> Finding those responsible for these attacks is extremely difficult. To begin with, the abductors do not usually make ransom demands; often there is no negotiation at all. The region's power politics are complex -- Gluck estimates there are 50 or 60 active military groups, and their alliances are rarely clear. So, when he was dragged from the car and MSF received no communication from his attackers, the trail quickly turned cold. The organization immediately suspended all its activities in the area and called on the Russian authorities to investigate, but even Gluck himself didn't know why he was being held. "They talked to me quite a bit, but I didn't feel that the people talking to me were the decision makers; they were just guards. They said they were hoping to trade me for captured people, but I don't know if that was true. They were Chechens, I could tell that, but I didn't know whether they were fighting on the Russian side or the anti-Russian side. I didn't get to those questions." </p><p> Gluck's case is proof that the best type of security is being known in the community. "All the Chechen doctors there knew me, and I had a lot of friends in this area, and they were getting in touch with everybody -- Russian groups, criminal groups, pro-Chechen groups -- saying this was unacceptable. People who deal in these activities get wounded a lot, so the Chechen surgeons had operated on a lot of people, and they just went to all their contacts and started pushing for my release. To each of the groups they thought could be involved they would say, "Look, your mother or your cousin was treated in an MSF-built surgical facility, with MSF drugs that Kenny himself brought in here. How can you do this? You have to take responsibility for getting him out.' Partly they were saying unethical things, like, "We're going to stop treating your people if this keeps going on.' </p><p> "My conditions improved dramatically after that first nine or ten days, and I'm pretty sure that around this time some of these doctors got lucky and talked to the right group. Someone was getting through to the kidnappers and saying, 'Treat him nicely.' After that, I was moved to a room that was about two meters by a meter and a half. They surprised me -- they came and asked what kind of food I wanted, what I needed. I didn't ask for any change in the food -- I thought it was fine before. They were just giving me normal Chechen village food, nothing surprising, and more than enough of it. What I said was, I need news, things to read, and they gave me that." </p><p> A few days after he was moved from the cellar, Gluck's captors assured him he had nothing to fear. "According to them it was settled, and it was just a matter of working out how I would be released. I was talking with them a lot about how to do it, and in the end they did exactly as I requested." He suggested that the kidnappers drop him off at the home of a Chechen surgeon who was a personal friend of his as well as being known among both the separatist and the pro-Russian groups. But the days dragged on and he began to wonder if it was false hope. "Things happened that were terrifying -- there were moments when I thought they were taking me outside to shoot me. There were times when the house shook so hard from the shelling that plaster was falling off the walls." </p><p> Finally, on the night of February 4, Gluck was told he was going to be freed. They put a mask over his head and bundled him out of the house and into a car. "In the car they were very apologetic. These were different people -- by their voices, I could tell these were older people, clearly with more authority. They were apologizing to MSF, saying, 'This group didn't know who you were, we're very sorry, we re going to punish them,' all of that. While I was blindfolded, they gave me back my passport. I had passes from the Russian military to travel in Chechnya, and they gave me those back, as well as my MSF ID card. I'd had seven hundred dollars in cash in my pocket, because we needed to make some advances on construction material, and they gave me that, which surprised me a lot. I'd had a very cheap watch which I always carried -- you know, seven dollars on Canal Street in New York -- and they said, 'We're really sorry, we can't find your watch.' I was like, 'I'll live.'" </p><p> Around midnight, the mystery voices stopped the car and pushed Gluck out. He asked whether he could remove the blindfold, but they refused, telling him simply to walk away from the cat Then they drove off. "I heard someone yelling at me in Chechen, so I said, 'I don't speak Chechen, speak to me in Russian.' And he said in a very crude way, 'Who the hell are you?'

This devastated me and I called another friend who confirmed that it was correct.<br><br>Just a few days ago -- some 46 years later -- a knowledgable new Teduray friend informed me that, in fact, Figel still exists, that he visits there regularly, and that there had been some survivors in 1971.

What he found was a group of people whose tolerant, gentle way of life would transform his own values and beliefs profoundly. <i>Wisdom from a Rainforest</i> is Schlegel's testament to his experience and to the Teduray people of Figel, from whom he learned such vital, lasting lessons.<br>Schlegel's lively ethnography of the Teduray portrays how their behavior and traditions revolved around kindness and compassion for humans, animals, and the spirits sharing their worlds. Schlegel describes the Teduray's remarkable legal system and their strong story-telling tradition, their elaborate cosmology, and their ritual celebrations. At the same time, Schlegel recounts his own transformation&#x2015;how his worldview as a member of an advanced, civilized society was shaken to the core by a so-called primitive people. He begins to realize how culturally determined his own values are and to see with great clarity how much the Teduray can teach him about gender equality, tolerance for difference, generosity, and cooperation.<br>By turns funny, tender, and gripping, <i>Wisdom from a Rainforest</i> honors the Teduray's legacy and helps us see how much we can learn from a way of life so different from our own.</p><p>A portrait of the vanished way of life of the Teduray people in the Philippine rainforest.STUART A.

In <i>Vast Expanses</i>, Helen M. Rozwadowski weaves a cultural, environmental, and geopolitical history of that relationship, a journey of tides and titanic forces reaching around the globe and across geological and evolutionary time.<br><br> Our ancient connections with the sea have developed and multiplied through industrialization and globalization, a trajectory that runs counter to Western depictions of the ocean as a place remote from and immune to human influence. Rozwadowski argues that knowledge about the oceans&#x2014;created through work and play, scientific investigation, and also through human ambitions for profiting from the sea&#x2014;has played a central role in defining our relationship with this vast, trackless, and opaque place. It has helped us to exploit marine resources, control ocean space, extend imperial or national power, and attempt to refashion the sea into a more tractable arena for human activity.<br><br> But while deepening knowledge of the ocean has animated and strengthened connections between people and the world&#x2019;s seas, to understand this history we must address questions of how, by whom, and why knowledge of the ocean was created and used&#x2014;and how we create and use this knowledge today. Only then can we can forge a healthier relationship with our future sea.</p><p>Founder of the University of Connecticut&#x2019;s Maritime Studies Program, <b>Helen M. Rozwadowski</b> teaches history of science, environmental history, and public history as well as interdisciplinary and experiential maritime-related courses. She is the author of <i>Fathoming the Ocean: The Discovery and Exploration of the Deep Sea</i> and coeditor of <i>Soundings and Crossings: Doing Science at Sea 1800&#x2013;1970</i>.<br> &nbsp;"Rozwadowski presents a timely and useful oceancentric natural history of the ocean-human relationship. Human understanding of the oceans, which cover much of the surface of the earth, is historically weak. Rarely curious about the waters from which life on earth rose, humans have long exploited the seas for food, transport, mining, recreation, and war. Until recently, it was assumed that ocean resources were inexhaustible, especially the bounty of fish and marine mammals, and that garbage and chemical waste dumped into oceans would just disappear. The idea that burning fossil fuels could raise ocean temperatures was unthinkable. Some forward-thinking individuals recognized warning signs centuries ago, but marine business and industry continued and grew with the exploding world population. Much bad science continued to support uncontrolled exploitation of the seas, even after the rise of the ecological movement of the latter half of the twentieth century. Rozwadowski thoroughly brings readers up-to-date on these essential issues of marine exploration and research and the environment."

Cut off from the rest of Russia, the city remained blockaded for 872 days, at a cost of almost a million civilian lives, making it one of the longest and deadliest sieges in modern history.</p><p><i>The War Within </i>chronicles the Leningrad blockade from the perspective of those who endured the unendurable. Drawing on 125 unpublished diaries written by individuals from all walks of Soviet life, Alexis Peri tells the tragic story of how citizens struggled to make sense of a world collapsing around them. Residents recorded in intimate detail the toll taken on minds and bodies by starvation, bombardment, and disease. For many, diary writing became instrumental to survival&#x2015;a tangible reminder of their humanity. The journals also reveal that Leningraders began to reexamine Soviet life and ideology from new, often critical perspectives.</p><p>Leningrad&#x2019;s party organization encouraged diary writing, hoping the texts would guide future histories of this epic battle. But in a bitter twist, the diarists became victims not only of Hitler but also of Stalin. The city&#x2019;s isolation from Moscow made it politically suspect. When the blockade was lifted in 1944, Kremlin officials censored publications describing the ordeal and arrested hundreds of Leningrad&#x2019;s wartime leaders. Many were executed. Diaries&#x2015;now dangerous to their authors&#x2015;were concealed in homes, shelved in archives, and forgotten. <i>The War Within</i> recovers these lost narratives, shedding light on one of World War II&#x2019;s darkest episodes.</p></p><p>Alexis Peri is Assistant Professor of History at Boston University.&#x201c;Synthesize[s] dozens of accounts to powerful and illuminating effect...A fascinating, insightful and nuanced work that incorporates much fresh research.

Much has been written about Leningrad&#x2019;s heroic resistance.

Between 1.6 million and two million Soviet citizens died, 800,000 of them civilians&#x2015;40 percent of the city&#x2019;s prewar population. (As Peri points out, the overall death toll approximates the total number of members of the U.S. military who died in war between 1776 and 1975.) Leningrad residents of all types&#x2015;from factory foremen to teachers, party workers to professional writers&#x2015;kept diaries during the ordeal. Peri searches through 125 of them to capture how the nightmare deconstructed the writers&#x2019; prior realities and altered their sense of humanity. Her portrait is a sensitive, at times almost poetic examination of their emotions and disordered mental states. It both contrasts with and complements the equally accurate official Soviet portrait of a stalwart population standing firm in the face of evil and in defense of Soviet ideals. Peri makes plain that even though the diarists endured the total transformation of their fundamental sense of reality, their social relationships, and the nature of their social order, most of them did not become alienated from the values and basic outlook of the Soviet system.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Legvold</b><b>, </b><b><i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A powerful book...In a groundbreaking history, Alexis Peri has sifted through scores of previously unpublished diaries that have lain largely forgotten for decades in Russian archives.

Today, these brutal events are symbolized by one word, Katyn&#x2014;a crime that still bitterly divides Poles and Russians. Paul�s richly updated account covers Russian attempts to recant their admission of guilt for the murders in Katyn Forest and includes recently translated documents from Russian military archives, eyewitness accounts of two perpetrators, and secret official minutes published here for the first time that confirm that U.S. government cover-up of the crime continued long after the war ended.Paul�s masterful narrative recreates what daily life was like for three Polish families amid momentous events of World War II&#x2014;from the treacherous Nazi-Soviet invasion in 1939 to a rigged election in 1947 that sealed Poland�s doom. The patriarch of each family was among the Polish officers personally ordered by Stalin to be shot. One of the families suffered daily repression under the German General Government. Like thousands of other Poles, two of the families were deported to Siberia, where they nearly died from forced labor, starvation, and neglect. Through painstaking research, the author reconstructs the lives of these families including such stories as a miraculous escape on the last transport of Poles leaving Russia and a mother�s daring ski trek over the Carpathian Mountains to rescue a daughter she had not seen in six years. At the heart of the drama is the Poles� uncommon belief in \u201cvictory in defeat\u201d&#x2014;that their struggles made them strong and that freedom and independence, inevitably, would be regained.</p></p><p>Marking the 70th anniversary of the Katyn, Forest massacre, this edition exposes the crime and its cover-up<p>Allen Paul is a former Associated Press reporter and political speechwriter.

Using production techniques that have never been duplicated, the Bomb Squad plundered<br>and reconfigured their own compositions to make frenetic splatter collages; they played samples by hand together in a<br>room like a rock band to create a "not quite right" tension; they hand-picked their samples from only the ugliest squawks and sirens.</p><br><p>Weingarten treats the samples used on Nation Of Millions as molecules of a greater whole, slivers of music that retain their own secret histories and folk traditions.

J. Park provides a penetrating account of a crucial period in the development of philosophy as an academic discipline. During these decades, a number of European philosophers influenced by Immanuel Kant began to formulate the history of philosophy as a march of progress from the Greeks to Kant&#x2015;a genealogy that supplanted existing accounts beginning in Egypt or Western Asia and at a time when European interest in Sanskrit and Persian literature was flourishing. Not without debate, these traditions were ultimately deemed outside the scope of philosophy and relegated to the study of religion. Park uncovers this debate and recounts the development of an exclusionary canon of philosophy in the decades of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. To what extent was this exclusion of Africa and Asia a result of the scientization of philosophy? To what extent was it a result of racism?<br><br>This book includes the most extensive description available anywhere of Joseph-Marie de G�rando&#x2019;s <i>Histoire compar�e des syst�mes de philosophie</i>, Friedrich Schlegel&#x2019;s lectures on the history of philosophy, Friedrich Ast&#x2019;s and Thadd� Anselm Rixner&#x2019;s systematic integration of Africa and Asia into the history of philosophy, and the controversy between G.

But when her next-door neighbor is murdered, and all her houseguests are prime suspects, her idyll turns prosaic, indeed....</p><p>When I read THE JAMES JOYCE MURDER, I instantly became a fan of Amanda Cross and her protagonist, English professor Kate Fansler. And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward. In time, I (and many other readers) came to realize that "Amanda Cross" is a pseudonym for Dr. Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half. Which has given me many opportunities to get to know Carolyn personally (it helps that we live only a few blocks from each other). So I've been in the company of this widely beloved author for autograph parties, bookstore events, an honorary dinner, and recently at the ALA (American Library Association) conference, where scores of adoring fans -- librarians and educators -- patiently queued up to get personally autographed copies of THE PUZZLED HEART, the latest Fansler mystery, as well as backlist titles in the series. Even with the resultant writer's cramp, it was a great day for "Amanda." And another cherished memory I have of this charming, gracious, and multitalented author.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher<b>Amanda Cross</b>&nbsp;is the pseudonymous author of the bestselling Kate Fansler mysteries.&nbsp;As Carolyn G.

Lillian Faderman persuasively argues that their lesbianism may in fact have facilitated their accomplishments. A book of impeccable research and compelling readability, TO BELIEVE IN WOMEN will be a source of enlightenment for all, and for many a singular source of pride.</p><p>Taking up where her 1981 classic, <i>Surpassing the Love of Men</i>, left off, Lillian Faderman reveals that many of the early leaders who fought for women's suffrage, higher education for women, and women's entrance into "male" professions would in today's parlance be called lesbians: "women who lived in committed relationships with other women." Unencumbered by the duties of marriage and motherhood, they were more likely to have the time, energy, and freedom to work for women's rights. In fact, they were more or less obliged to try to better women's lives, Faderman argues, for there was no man to represent them at the polls or support them financially. (Although Elizabeth Cady Stanton's husband and seven children failed to distract her from the cause, her friend Susan B. Anthony used to help her with the children and housework before they settled down for political strategy meetings.) During the Depression, when women's social and economic gains began to dwindle, it was these "single" women who kept professions open while married women were being fired in favor of men. Faderman gracefully surveys a century of advancement and retreat, shedding light on America's debt to women-loving women. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Lillian Faderman is the author of such acclaimed works as To Believe in Women, Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers, and Surpassing the Love of Men. Among the many honors her work has received are the Yale University James Brudner Award for Exemplary Scholarship in Lesbian/Gay Studies, three Lambda Literary Awards, and the Paul Monette Award.

From the hot Kiev summers to the cruel winters of St Petersburg and eventually to springtime in Paris, the would-be writer H�l�ne blossoms, despite her mother&#x2019;s neglect, into a clear-eyed observer of the life around her. Here is a powerful tale of disillusionment &#x2014; the story of an upbringing that produces a young woman as hard as a diamond, prepared to wreak a shattering revenge on her mother.<br><br>A Vintage Paperback Original</p><p><b>Ir�ne N�mirovsky</b> was born in Kiev in 1903 into a wealthy banking family and immigrated to France during the Russian Revolution. After attending the Sorbonne in Paris, she began to write and swiftly achieved success with <i>David Golder,</i> which was followed by more than a dozen other books. Throughout her lifetime she published widely in French newspapers and literary journals. She died in Auschwitz in 1942. More than sixty years later, <i>Suite Fran�aise</i> was published posthumously for the first time in 2006.<b>Chapter 1.</b><br><br>In the part of the world where H�l�ne Karol was born, dusk began with a thick cloud of dust that swirled slowly in the air before drifting to the ground, bringing the damp night with it. A hazy, reddish light lingered low in the sky; the wind brought the smell of the Ukrainian plains to the city, a mild yet bitter scent of smoke, cold water and rushes that grew along the riverbanks. The wind blew in from Asia; it had pushed its way between the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea; it brought with it whirls of yellow dust that cracked between the teeth; it was dry and biting; it filled the air with a howl that faded as it disappeared towards the west. Then all was calm. The setting sun, pale and dull, veiled behind whitish clouds, sank deep into the river.<br> &nbsp;<br> From the Karols&#x2019; balcony you could see the whole town, from the Dnieper River to the hills in the distance; its outline was marked out by the gaslights that lined the winding streets with their fluttering little flames, while on the opposite bank the first fires of spring smouldered in the grass.<br> The balcony was surrounded by boxes full of flowers that had been especially chosen because they opened at night, Nicotiana, Sweet Mignonette, Tuberoses; the balcony was so wide that it could hold the dining table and chairs, a wicker &#x2018;love-seat&#x2019; and the armchair of Safronov, H�l�ne&#x2019;s grandfather.<br> &nbsp;<br> The family sat around the table, eating in silence; the flame from the gas lamp attracted delicate moths with beige wings. Leaning forward, H�l�ne could see the acacias in the courtyard, lit up in the moonlight. The courtyard was bare and dirty but lined with trees and flowers, like a garden. On summer evenings the servants sat down there, talking and laughing among themselves; sometimes a white skirt could be seen moving about in the darkness; they could hear an accordion playing and a muffled cry: &#x2018;Let go of me, you devil!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Well, they&#x2019;re not bored down there...&#x2019; said Madame Karol, looking up.<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne was half asleep in her chair. At this time of year, they ate late; she could feel her legs trembling, aching from having run around the garden; her chest rose and fell quickly as she remembered the shrill cries she couldn&#x2019;t help but make as she ran after the hoop, cries like the song of some bird. Her small rough hand loved touching her favourite black ball, which she had hidden in the pocket of her tartan skirt even though it left bruises as it pressed into her leg. She was eight years old; she wore a dress of broderie anglaise with a white silk belt tied below her waist in a &#x2018;butterfly&#x2019; bow fixed in place with two pins. Bats flew by and as each one swooped down low, Mademoiselle Rose, H�l�ne&#x2019;s French governess, let out a little cry and laughed.<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne half opened her tired eyes and looked at her family. Her father&#x2019;s face was surrounded by a sort of yellowish haze that shimmered like a halo: to her weary eyes it looked as if the light from the lamp was flickering, but yes, it really <i>was</i> flickering. The lamp had begun to smoke; H�l�ne&#x2019;s grandmother shouted to the servant, &#x2018;Macha! Lower the lamp!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne&#x2019;s mother sighed, yawned and flicked through Paris fashion magazines while she ate.<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne&#x2019;s father said nothing, softly drumming his slim, delicate fingers on the table.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was the only one whom H�l�ne resembled; she looked exactly like him. It was from him she had inherited her passion-ate eyes, wide mouth, curly hair and swarthy com-plexion that turned almost yellow whenever she was sad or ill. She looked at him tenderly. But he only had eyes for his wife. His loving caresses were only for her too.<br> &nbsp;<br> She pushed away his hand. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t, Boris,&#x2019; she said, sullen and irritable. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s hot, leave me be...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> She pulled the lamp towards her, leaving the others in darkness; she sighed with boredom and weariness, curling strands of her hair round her fingers. She was a tall, shapely woman &#x2018;of regal bearing&#x2019; and with a tendency to plumpness, which she fought by using corsets shaped liked breastplates, as was the fashion; her breasts nestled in two satin pockets, like fruit in a basket. Her arms were white and powdered. H�l�ne felt a strange sensation, close to revulsion, when she saw her mother&#x2019;s snow-white skin, pale, languid hands and claw-like nails. H�l�ne&#x2019;s grandfather completed the family circle.<br> &nbsp;<br> The moon spilled its tranquil light over the tops of the lime trees; nightingales sang beyond the hills. The Dnieper shimmered a dazzling white. The moonlight shone on the nape of Madame Karol&#x2019;s neck, which was as pale and hard as marble; it reflected off Boris Karol&#x2019;s silvery hair and the short, tapered beard of the elderly Safronov; it cast a dim light on the small, wrinkled, angular features of her grandmother: she was only fifty but she looked so old, so weary... The silence of this sleepy provincial town, lost deep within Russia, was intense, heavy and overwhelmingly sad. Then, suddenly, the stillness was broken by the sound of a carriage jolting along the paved street: the terrible din of a lashing whip, swearing the bump of wheels against stone, which faded and disappeared into the distance... Nothing more... silence... just the rustling of birds&#x2019; wings in the trees... the sound of a distant song from some country road, interrupted by the noise of arguments, shouting, the thud of a policeman&#x2019;s boots, the screams of a drunken woman being dragged to the police station by the hair... Silence once more...<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne gently pinched her arms so she wouldn&#x2019;t fall asleep; her cheeks burned as if they were on fire. Her dark curls kept her neck warm; she ran her fingers through her hair, lifting it up; she thought angrily that it was only her long hair that kept her from beating the boys when they raced: they grabbed it while she was running; she smiled with pride recalling how she had kept her balance on the slippery edge of the fountain. Her arms and legs were racked with agonising but exhilarating exhaustion; she secretly rubbed her painful knees, covered in scratches and bruises; her passionate blood pulsed quietly, deep within her body; she kicked the underside of the table impatiently, hammering its wood and sometimes her grandmother&#x2019;s legs, who said nothing so H�l�ne wouldn&#x2019;t be scolded.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Put your hands on the table,&#x2019; Madame Karol said sharply.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then she continued reading her fashion magazine.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Tea-gown in lemon-yellow twilled silk with eighteen orange velvet bows to fasten the bodice...&#x2019; she said with a sigh, forming each word with longing.<br> &nbsp;<br> She wound a curl of her shiny dark hair round her fingers and stroked it against her cheek as if in a dream. She was bored: she didn&#x2019;t like meeting up with other women to smoke and play cards, as they all did as soon as they were over thirty. Looking after the house and her child filled her with horror. She was only happy in a hotel, in a room with a bed and a trunk, in Paris...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Ah, Paris!&#x2019; she thought, closing her eyes. &#x2018;To eat at the bar of the Chauffeurs&#x2019; Caf�, to sleep in a train compartment, even if necessary on the hard benches in third class, but to be alone and free!&#x2019; Here, from every window, the women looked her up and down, glaring at her Parisian dresses, her make-up, the man she was with. Here, every married woman had a lover, whom the children called &#x2018;Uncle&#x2019; and who played cards with their husbands. &#x2018;Why bother having a lover at all, then?&#x2019; she thought, remembering the men who followed her around in Paris, men she didn&#x2019;t know... That, at least, was exciting, dangerous, thrilling... To hold a man tightly in her arms when she didn&#x2019;t even know his name or where he came from, a man she would never see again, that and that alone gave her the sharp thrill of pleasure she desired.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Ah,&#x2019; she thought, &#x2018;I wasn&#x2019;t destined to be a placid middle-class woman, satisfied with her husband and child.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> They had finished their meal; Karol pushed away his plate and set out the roulette wheel purchased the previous year in Nice. Everyone gathered round him: he threw the ivory ball almost angrily, but every now and again, when the sound of the accordion echoed more loudly from the courtyard, he would raise his long finger in the air and, without interrupting his game of roulette, he would hum the tune they played with extreme accuracy, then softly whistle it through his half-open lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Do you remember Nice, H�l�ne?&#x2019; said Madame Karol.<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne did remember Nice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;And Paris? You haven&#x2019;t forgotten Paris, have you?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne felt her heart melt with tenderness at the memory of Paris, the Tuileries Gardens... (Trees the colour of tarnished steel beneath the tender winter sky, the sweet smell of the rain, and in the heavy, misty dusk, the yellowish moon that rose slowly above the column in the Place Vend�me...)<br> &nbsp;<br> Karol had forgotten everyone else around him. He drummed his fingers nervously on the table and watched the little ivory ball wildly spin and sway. &#x2018;Black, red, the 2, the 8... Ah! I would have won... Forty-four times what I&#x2019;d bet. And with just one gold louis.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> But it was over almost too quickly. There wasn&#x2019;t time to enjoy the uncertainty or the danger, the despair in defeat or the exhilaration of victory. Baccarat, now there was an idea... But he was still too poor for that, too unimportant. One day, perhaps...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Ah, dear God,&#x2019; the elderly Madame Safronov murmured. &#x2018;Ah, dear God!&#x2019; It was an habitual refrain. She had a slight limp in one leg, but walked quickly: her features were faded, washed out by her tears, like a very old photograph; her yellowish wrinkled neck sat above the frilled little collar of her white blouse. She continually brought her hand to rest against her flat chest, as if every word she said would make her heart pound; she was always sad, complaining, anxious: everything was an excuse for her to sigh, to lament. &#x2018;Life is bad,&#x2019; she would say. &#x2018;God is terrible. Men are harsh...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> She turned to her daughter. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re right, you know, Bella. Enjoy life while you&#x2019;re still in good health. Eat something. Do you want some of this? A bit of that? Do you want my chair, my knife, my bread, my food? Take it... Take it, Boris, and you, Bella, and you, George, and you my darling H�l�ne...&#x2019; Take my time, my care, my blood, my flesh... she seemed to be saying as she stared at them with her soft, dead eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> But everyone pushed her away. Then she would shake her head affectionately and force herself to smile. &#x2018;All right, all right, I&#x2019;ll be quiet, I won&#x2019;t say anything...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, George Safronov had sat up straighter, lifting his tall, dry body and bald head, while carefully examining his fingernails. He polished them twice a day: all morning long, and once before the evening meal. He was not interested in the conversation of women. Boris Karol was a peasant. &#x2018;He should consider himself very lucky to have married Safronov&#x2019;s daughter...&#x2019; He opened out his newspaper.<br> &nbsp;<br> H�l�ne read the word &#x2018;War&#x2019;. &#x2018;Is there going to be a war, Grandfather?&#x2019; she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;What?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Whenever she opened her mouth, everyone eyed her scornfully and waited a moment before speaking, firstly to find out her mother&#x2019;s opinion on what she&#x2019;d said and then presumably because she was so unimportant, so young, that they felt they had to travel a great distance just to reach her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;War? And where have you heard talk of... ? Oh! Maybe, no one knows...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I really hope not,&#x2019; said H�l�ne, sensing it was what she was supposed to say.<br> &nbsp;<br> They all looked at her and laughed nervously; her father smiled with a tender, melancholy, mocking expression.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;What a clever thing to say,&#x2019; said Bella dismissively. &#x2018;If there&#x2019;s a war, fabric will be more expensive... You do know that Papa owns a textile factory, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> She laughed but without opening her mouth: her thin lips formed a harsh line that cut across her face and were always pinched, either to make her mouth seem smaller, or to hide the gold tooth at the back, or because she wanted to look refined. She raised her head and noticed the clock: &#x2018;Time for bed. Off you go...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her grandmother put out her arm when H�l�ne walked past; her anxious eyes and weary face grew tense. &#x2018;Give Grandma a hug and a kiss...&#x2019; And when the impatient, ungrateful, deeply irritated child allowed herself to be held for a moment by the thin old woman, she crushed H�l�ne to her breast with all her might.<br> &nbsp;<br> The only kiss H�l�ne accepted and returned with joy was her father&#x2019;s. She felt related and close to him alone, part of his flesh and blood, sharing his soul, his strength, his weaknesses. He leaned down towards her with his silvery white hair that looked almost green in the moonlight; his face was still young, but wrinkled, furrowed by cares; his eyes were sometimes intense and sad, sometimes lit up with the fire of mischievous cheerfulness; he tugged playfully at her hair. &#x2018;Goodnight, Lenoussia, my little one...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> She left them, and at that very instant serenity and joy, along with pure and simple affection, returned to her heart; she held Mademoiselle Rose&#x2019;s hand in hers. She went to bed and fell asleep. Mademoiselle Rose sat sewing in the golden beam of the lamp; its light shone across her thin, bare little hand. A shaft of moonlight pushed through the white ruched blind. Mademoiselle Rose was lost in thought. &#x2018;H�l�ne needs new dresses, pinafores, socks... H�l�ne is growing up too quickly...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Occasionally a noise, a flash of lightning, the shadow of a bat, a cockroach on the white stove made her shudder. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll never get used to this place,&#x2019; she sighed. &#x2018;Never...&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br></p><h2>The Little Book: A Novel</h2><p><b>A marvelous debut novel about love and basketball, time travel and rock'n'roll.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Thirty years in the writing, Selden Edwards' dazzling first novel is an irresistible triumph of the imagination. Wheeler Burden-banking heir, philosopher, student of history, legend's son, rock idol, writer, lover, recluse, half-Jew, and Harvard baseball hero-one day finds himself wandering not in his hometown of San Francisco in 1988 but in a city and time he knows mysteriously well: Vienna, 1897. <br><br>Before long, Wheeler acquires a mentor in Sigmund Freud, a bitter rival, a powerful crush on a luminous young woman, and encounters everyone from an eight-year-old Adolf Hitler to Mark Twain as well as the young members of his own family. Solving the riddle of Wheeler's dislocation in time will ultimately reveal nothing short of one eccentric family's unrivaled impact upon the course of human history.<br><br>Edwards&nbsp;brilliantly weaves romance, art, sci-fi, history, and culture in this unforgettable debut novel. A great YA read for those looking for a true adventure!</p><p><b>Selden Edwards</b> began writing <i>The Little Book</i> as a young English teacher in 1974, and continued to layer and refine the manuscript until its completion in 2007. He most recently authored <i>The Lost Prince</i>. He spent his career as headmaster at several independent schools across the country, and for over forty years has been secretary of his class at Princeton, where he also played basketball. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.<p> </p><p> Reviewed by Ron Charles</p><p>[...] When California rock legend Wheeler Burden wakes up in 1897 Vienna -- 50 years before his own birth -- he has no idea how he got there or how he'll get back, but he recognizes the city from the stories told by his favorite prep school teacher. [...] </p><p>What's weirdest about this weird story is how straight-faced Edwards plays it. As The Little Book jumps back and forth in time, everything here signals the wackiness of John Irving or John Barth, but Edwards moves through his chronology-scrambled fantasy with such earnestness and nostalgia that he smothers its potential comedy.</p><p>That problem is particularly egregious in the chapters at the St. Gregory's School in Boston, where Wheeler spends his teen years. There we meet his prep school mentor, Arnauld Esterhazy, nicknamed "the Venerable Haze," who's taught history for more than 40 years. Edwards, who went to a Boston prep school himself and later worked for several private schools, suggests in an author's note that these scenes stem from beloved memories, but that lack of emotional distance leaves no room for irony. The narrator lavishes all kinds of apparently sincere praise upon the Venerable Haze, but to me he sounds like Miss Jean Brodie in drag. Haze refers to his student devotees as his "Jung Wien." When he first meets Wheeler, he says, "We have much to learn from you, Herr Burden, as we begin writing on your tabula rasa." He prattles on about Vienna during its "time of delusive splendor." He frequently reads passages about the city "with great reverence" from "his prized source, the 'Little Book,' " and then asks the kids, "Isn't that writing absolutely exquisite?" This sounds satirical, but it's not meant to be. Edwards claims that "over the years his Jung Wien, sophisticated private school boys who could be cynical about so much in their lives, rarely directed any of their derision at the 'Little Book.' " We never hear anything from this book ourselves, but we're told again and again how great it is.</p><p>In fact, Edwards makes so many hyperbolic claims that The Little Book begins to sound rather flat, like a tall tale told without a wink. Edwards can't stop petting Wheeler and reminding us how wonderful he is. Of course, he's incredibly good looking and sexually athletic, but he also writes a foundational work of 20th-century philosophy and inspires "the beginning of the American feminist movement." (You didn't think women could do that on their own, did you?) And he throws the fastest pitch in college baseball (at Harvard, naturally). Then he writes "the most famous song of the 1970s" and becomes "one of People magazine's Most Recognizable." Then he publishes a bestselling book in the 1980s. The whole narrative is soggy with hero-worship, like the fantasy of a skinny teenage boy staring into a mirror.</p><p>Edwards does far better describing the coffeehaus culture of prewar Vienna in all its beauty, political agitation and rising anti-Semitism. Some of the historical figures here during the fin de si�cle make nice cameos, too, such as Gustav Mahler and Mark Twain. After Wheeler pops into the late 19th century, he supports himself in Vienna by telling the story of his life to a young doctor named Sigmund Freud, who's convinced this strange man is seriously delusional. Their discussions provide an interesting snapshot of Freud's work in progress, but, unfortunately, the doctor never springs to life, largely because Edwards won't allow anyone to upstage Wheeler. Even the founder of modern psychology must take pointers from this brilliant rock-star time-traveler.</p><p>In the end we learn that Wheeler's family is responsible for just about every major event in the 20th century. Including the Frisbee. But we never know why or why their "lives weave together in a fatal and continuous and repeating loop." [...] </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

But even though Merit has had wild adventures, this may be her deadliest yet....<br>&nbsp;<br>A killer is stalking Chicago, preying on humans and leaving his victims with magical souvenirs. The CPD hasn&#x2019;t been able to track the assailant, and as the body count rises, the city is running out of options. Vampires and humans aren&#x2019;t on great terms, but murder makes for strange bedfellows. Can Merit find the killer before she becomes a target?</p><p><b>Chloe Neill&nbsp;</b>was born and raised in the South, but now makes her home in the Midwest--just close enough to Cadogan House and St. Sophia's to keep an eye on things. When not transcribing Merit's and Lily's adventures in the Chicagoland Vampires Novels (<i>House Rules</i>, <i>Biting Bad</i>, <i>Wild Things</i>), she bakes, works, and scours the Internet for good recipes and great graphic design. Chloe also maintains her sanity by spending time with her boys--her favorite landscape photographer and their dogs, Baxter and Scout.<b>Chapter One</b><p>Early March</p><p>Chicago, Illinois</p><p>He stood beside me as cameras flashed, a man with a long and lean body, deeply green eyes, and golden hair. He wore shorts, sneakers, and a long-sleeved shirt that snugged against the tight muscles of his torso. His hair, which normally brushed his shoulders, was pulled back in a queue, and around his neck glinted the silver pendant that marked him as a Cadogan vampire.</p><p>But he wasn&#x2019;t just a vampire. Ethan Sullivan was Master of Cadogan House.</p><p>Even in running shoes, hands on his hips as he stood beneath the yellow arch that marked the starting line, a clock counting down to zero a few feet away, his Masterdom was undeniable. He looked nothing less than a leader of his people.</p><p>He glanced at me, an eyebrow arched in his usual imperious expression. &#x201c;Sentinel. You appear to be enjoying this a little too much.&#x201d;</p><p>I pulled my long dark hair into a ponytail using the elastic on my wrist, my long bangs across my forehead. I was also dressed in running attire&#x2014;a Cadogan House Track shirt, midcalf running tights, and shoes in eye-searing neon orange that made me smile when I looked at them. But the apparel wasn&#x2019;t just fun; it was functional. It had to be if I was going to achieve my goal: beating Ethan Sullivan to the finish line.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not every day I get the chance to best you in front of an audience.&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan snorted, a glint of amusement in his eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t plan to let you best me, Sentinel. But I&#x2019;m prepared to make it interesting.&#x201d;</p><p>There was heat in his eyes that nearly made me blush. But since we had an audience, I held it in. &#x201c;How interesting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dinner. Of the winner&#x2019;s choosing.&#x201d;</p><p>As a lover of food, I didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t finished,&#x201d; he said with a sly smile. &#x201c;Dinner of the winner&#x2019;s choosing&#x2014;in the apparel of the winner&#x2019;s choosing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do enjoy seeing you in jeans,&#x201d; I countered. He generally preferred fancy to casual, but even he couldn&#x2019;t run in a refined French suit and Italian loafers. But if the look in his eyes was any indication, he hadn&#x2019;t intended denim, leather, or wool.</p><p>He only snorted in response.</p><p>It was March in Chicago, and the air still carried the chill of winter. But spring had nearly broken winter&#x2019;s hold, and a thousand people stood on the sidelines to watch the Cadogan Dash, a race we&#x2019;d organized to raise money for Chicago&#x2019;s food bank.</p><p>I was the House&#x2019;s social chair, and I&#x2019;d been reminded recently about the importance of giving back. So I decided a charity event was just the thing, which was why we were standing in Grant Park on a brisk spring night, preparing to run three miles with a few hundred friends. While Malik, the second-in-command of the House, stayed behind (and separate from Ethan for succession purposes), others gathered in their running gear for a little friendly competition. Luc, the Cadogan guard captain, with his dark blond locks. Connor, a young vampire of my class with the easygoing personality of casual wealth. Brody, a new Cadogan guard with mile-long legs that were probably going to come in handy tonight.</p><p>But that didn&#x2019;t mean the race was just fun and games.</p><p>Times had been tough for Chicago&#x2019;s supernaturals, but humans&#x2019; attitudes had seemed to improve over the last few weeks. Ethan had been cleared of charges he&#x2019;d killed a vampire in cold blood; it had been obvious self-defense, since we&#x2019;d been attacked at Cadogan House. My grandfather, Chuck Merit, was once again the city&#x2019;s official Supernatural Ombudsman, helping vampires, shifters, River nymphs, and the like with their various problems. And once again, the fickle pendulum of human emotion had swung to love. Sure, there were vampire detractors. Vampire haters. Vampire conspiracy theorists. But there were also members of the Ethan Sullivan fan club.</p><p>Most of the human spectators who&#x2019;d crowded behind the barrier wore T-shirts bearing Ethan&#x2019;s image and I HEART ETHAN buttons. But much to my surprise, Ethan wasn&#x2019;t the only Cadogan vamp with fans in the audience. There were a few fans carrying hand-painted I HEART MERITsigns and wearing #1 SENTINEL T-shirts, which was cool, if a little unnerving.</p><p>A woman on the other side of the barricade held out a glossy eight-by-ten photograph and a permanent marker. &#x201c;Ethan! Ethan! Can I have your autograph?&#x201d; Her face was flushed with excitement, her eyes wide with promise.</p><p>&#x201c;Your fans await,&#x201d; I said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my favorite fan,&#x201d; he said, and in full view of the cameras, spectators, and news vans, he kissed me.</p><p>By the time he straightened again, my cheeks were pink and Ethan&#x2019;s admirers were screaming with gusto. Apparently it didn&#x2019;t matter whom the golden god kissed&#x2014;the sight of him kissing was enough to send them into a frenzy.</p><p>Given the look of intensity in their eyes, I doubted they&#x2019;d have felt any compunction about kicking me out of the way to get a little closer to him.</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Go see your admirers. Sign some autographs. It&#x2019;s good PR for the House.&#x201d;</p><p>He slid me a glance, smiled. &#x201c;Not concerned one of the fans will try to sweep me away with words of love?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, they&#x2019;ll try to sweep,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I have no worries you&#x2019;ll come back to me.&#x201d;</p><p>His smile was meltingly handsome. &#x201c;Because I love you without measure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Also, I had the car keys.</p><p>We needed the good PR while we could get it. I had a sinking suspicion the tide would turn again; humans always looked for scapegoats. Supernaturals made easy targets.</p><p>Humans weren&#x2019;t our only problem. Cadogan House had recently left the Greenwich Presidium, the European council of vampires that ruled European and North American vampires&#x2014;but we hadn&#x2019;t left behind the drama. The GP was a hot mess. Some council members hated our House; others hated humans. It was an organization generally out of touch with the modern world.</p><p>And Ethan, who&#x2019;d moved forward to commune with the crowd, was petitioning to take charge of it. He&#x2019;d filed the paperwork a week ago. Which was awkward, since the GP already had a leader&#x2014;Darius West, a powerful vampire whose unfortunate involvement with an American serial killer had stunted him emotionally, an impressive feat for an immortal. After ensuring the House and its finances were in order, Ethan announced his candidacy, and we&#x2019;d heard nothing in the interim.</p><p>Darius had options. Vampires loved rules, and the Canon, the volumes of vampire law, laid out three official responses to Ethan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Honorable Challenge.&#x201d; (Vampires also liked capitalizing things.) According to the Canon, Darius could give back snarky words, a response &#x201c;by Wit,&#x201d; which I imagined would have been something like &#x201c;Bring it&#x201d; or &#x201c;You just got served.&#x201d; Darius could challenge Ethan to a duel, presumably by katana, since that was the favored vampire weapon, or by &#x201c;account of All Houses,&#x201d; which basically meant that Darius could call out all the other vampire Houses to gang up on ours.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t done any of those things yet, and the silence was more unnerving than an outright attack would have been. In the interim, Ethan called the Masters of the Houses that allied with Cadogan&#x2014;whose insignia were mounted above the Cadogan House door&#x2014;shoring up his support.</p><p>We&#x2019;d decided to move forward with the race, but we were certainly, obviously keeping a close eye on Ethan. Because I was Sentinel of the House, his safety was one of my priorities. And I had allies in the crowd: my grandfather&#x2019;s employees&#x2014;Catcher Bell, a sorcerer, and Jeff Christopher, a shifter&#x2014;as well as the undercover members of the Red Guard, an organization of vampires created to keep watch on the GP and the twelve American vampire Masters.</p><p>Catcher&#x2019;s girlfriend and my non-vampire best pal, Mallory Carmichael&#x2014;a sorceress in her own right&#x2014;stood with Jeff and Catcher, her blue ombr� hair in a high topknot, a small Cadogan pennant in her hand. She waved the pennant at me, her blue eyes smiling, and gave me a very enthusiastic thumbs-up.</p><p>The RG members wore Midnight High School T-shirts to indicate their affiliation. They included my tall, handsome, and auburn-haired RG partner, Jonah, who stood near a woman vigorously shaking her d�colletage at Ethan as he signed autographs. I gave the woman the stink eye, but her gaze skimmed right over me. I wasn&#x2019;t the object of her affection.</p><p>&#x201c;They just pretend we aren&#x2019;t here.&#x201d;</p><p>I chuckled at the vampire beside me, a woman with a blond ponytail, hot pink shirt, and black running tights that skimmed her long legs. She was Lindsey, one of Cadogan&#x2019;s guards and Luc&#x2019;s sweetheart. And Luc had plenty of fans of his own, men and women who giggled each time he flipped his tousled curls out of his eyes. From the cheeky grin on his face, he didn&#x2019;t seem to mind the attention.</p><p>&#x201c;The humans or the vampires?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Lindsey snorted. &#x201c;Good question. I&#x2019;m not sure Luc could pick me out of a lineup right now. Especially not when she&#x2019;s showing off the kids.&#x201d; She nodded toward a woman with pendulous cleavage and Luclicious tattooed in black script across her chest.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s never going to stop talking about that,&#x201d; I agreed.</p><p>&#x201c;At least you have your own fans. There&#x2019;s one very delectable man who hasn&#x2019;t taken his eyes off you. Your two o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; she said, and I glanced casually over.</p><p>He had dark skin and a shaved head, a sprinkling of goatee beneath his generous mouth. His eyes were wide set and deeply brown. There was a small crescent-shaped tattoo near the corner of his left eye.</p><p>His gaze was direct, curious, and focused on me.</p><p>I looked back at Lindsey, mouth open. &#x201c;He is stunning.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;See? Fans of your own. As long as Ethan doesn&#x2019;t see him and beat him to a bloody pulp for staring at you, we&#x2019;re good. And even if he does,&#x201d; Lindsey said with a grin, stretching out one calf, then the other, &#x201c;your backup fan club is right over there.&#x201d; She gestured to the Ombuddies, as we called Jeff and Catcher.</p><p>&#x201c;They aren&#x2019;t fans; they&#x2019;re family.&#x201d; Maybe not genetically, but certainly in spirit. And, considering Catcher&#x2019;s YES, I HATE EVERYBODY T-shirt, despite their personality quirks.</p><p>&#x201c;Besides. They&#x2019;re on the job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of, any twinges?&#x201d;</p><p>Vampires preferred to fight with katanas, and my own weapon had been tempered with my blood, giving me the ability to sense other weapons nearby. I&#x2019;d mentally calibrated my senses to ignore the hidden blades carried by the RG members, and thus far, the crowd was clean.</p><p>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; I said, scanning the bystanders, who smiled and snapped pictures. &#x201c;All&#x2019;s well so far. Hopefully it will stay that way.&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey snorted. &#x201c;Darling, we&#x2019;re vampires. It will definitely not stay that way.&#x201d;</p><p>An unfortunate but valid point.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, runners,&#x201d; said the race director through his bullhorn. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re less than a minute away from the start. Please get ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good luck,&#x201d; Lindsey said, squeezing my arm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be right behind you.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;You, too. Keep a sharp eye.&#x201d;</p><p>She winked. &#x201c;The sharpest.&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan joined us, retying his hair with a bit of leather cord, and we moved to the front of the pack of runners, who were stretching their hamstrings and turning at the waist to loosen up.</p><p>He smiled at me, and I pushed down a bolt of lust that speared through me&#x2014;and kicked up my heart rate better than any warm-up session.</p><p>Ethan leaned forward, elbows and knees bent. &#x201c;Ready, Sentinel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Always,&#x201d; I said with my own cocky grin. I rolled my shoulders, mirrored his stance, and prepared to move.</p><p>&#x201c;Get set!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dinner will be poulet � la bretonne,&#x201d; Ethan said, an obvious threat that I think involved French chicken.</p><p>&#x201c;Hot wings,&#x201d; I countered, and Ethan shuddered.</p><p>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; said the race director, and the shrill blare of an air horn filled the air.</p><p>I pulled up every ounce of strength I could manage and jumped off the line, inching out steps ahead of Ethan and trucking it down the street. Vampire strength varied. Some vamps were superstrong and superfast; others were barely stronger than humans. Fortunately, I was both. And so was Ethan.</p><p>I&#x2019;d decided to make an aggressive start, to push out and try to get an early lead on him. I had to hope I could keep up the pace and wouldn&#x2019;t run out of steam before the finish line.</p><p>Two blocks down the road, I realized that might have been wishful thinking. He was taller than me, with longer legs, and as strong and fast as they came. He matched my pace, sidling alongside me with determined eyes and an easy smile.</p><p>Boeuf bourguignon, Ethan silently said, activating the mental link between us.</p><p>Tater Tot casserole, I challenged. He wouldn&#x2019;t beat me at that game. I was tall and trim from years of ballet and my vampire metabolism, but I knew food the way Ethan knew investments and European shoes. I could match him threat for threat without breaking a sweat.</p><p>A good thing, as the run was accomplishing that pretty well. We moved like machines, each joint and muscle moving precisely and so quickly our bodies blurred.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t see the rest of the pack, but I could hear them behind me&#x2014;the front-runners bunched a few yards behind us, apparently content to let Ethan and me battle for the lead.</p><p>And battle we did. He wasn&#x2019;t going to give me this win, or submit to a dinner of chip-laden casseroles or meats on sticks. But he hadn&#x2019;t made a weak vampire; I wasn&#x2019;t one to give up, either. I glanced at him, saw the sweat that beaded on his forehead, tightened my core, and moved. Even as I scanned the dark street for threats, I pushed forward.</p><p>As a pseudo member of the House&#x2019;s guard corps, I trained every day, and I was pushing to inch ahead. Centimeter by centimeter, I took the lead, my blood pumping and heart pounding. Two feet, then three.</p><p>Members of the CPD perched on motorcycles blocked intersections, waving and whistling as we passed. The blocks sped by, the concrete and glass of downtown Chicago, the cafes and tourist shops. Humans lined the streets, some curious to get a look at us, and some with nastier signs that claimed our appearance signaled the end of the world. Since vampires had lived among humans since the dawn of time, the logic was disappointingly faulty.</p><p>We turned onto State, sped toward the Chicago River and then across the bascule bridge that crossed the road. Ethan was only a step behind me, probably on purpose, drifting in my wake to make his effort easier.</p><p>But I wasn&#x2019;t interested in making it easier for him.</p><p>One mile passed, then two, in much the same way. My legs began to heavy and tire, but I ignored it, pressed on, pushed harder. Maybe it was wrong or childish, but I wanted to win. I loved and respected Ethan, but tonight I wanted to beat him. I wanted to blow past him at the finish, triumph in my victory, and celebrate with food so fried, battered, and processed that it was hardly recognizable.</p><p>We made our final turn onto the straightaway that led to the finish.</p><p>Eyes trained on the arch, I narrowed my gaze, using every muscle in my body to propel my feet along, faster, faster, faster.</p><p>But then I heard them, the fans screaming at the finish line. &#x201c;Ethan! Ethan! Ethan!&#x201d; They were cheering for him, hoping for him to win. Waiting for him to win. He was their superstar.</p><p>I wanted to beat him . . . but not ne...</p></p><h2>Cappiello: The Posters of Leonetto Cappiello</h2><p>Leonetto Cappiello is the Father of the Modern Poster.

It was the most extensive dramatic treatment of modern science since Jonson's <i>The Alchemist</i> and took as its target no less than the Royal Society of London. Shadwell's barbs hit their targets often and cleanly. In 1689 he became Poet Laureate of England, a position he held until his death in 1692.</p><p>The virtuoso of the title is Sir Nicholas Gimcrack, who like many after him confuses the extent of a collection with the depth of a science. Sir Gimcrack is fascinated by the geography of the moon, the worlds in his microscope, and the possibilities of human flight. More seriously and&#x2014;for Shadwell's audience&#x2014;more comically, his obsession with his arrays of worms and spiders proceeds at the expense of his wife and two beautiful nieces.</p><p>The play also introduces Sir Formal Trifle, a pedantic ciceronian orator and coxcomb. His character established thereafter the theatrical type of the know-it-all blowhard. Famous for its wit and high-speed changes, The Virtuoso is also a display of the prestige of modern science and the pomposity of its ameteurs.</p></p><p></p><h2>Down Among the Dead Men (A Detective Peter Diamond Mystery)</h2><p>&#x201c;What'll it be today?

Where did you leave car?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A little way up the street.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What make?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the old white Merc by the lamppost.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Locking is remote, right?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny dipped his hand in his pocket, opened his palm and showed the key fob with its push button controls.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; Mr. Singh said. &#x201c;We can test. Go to car and let yourself in. Step out, lock up and walk back here. I am waiting on street with gizmo.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny was alert for trickery. He wasn&#x2019;t parting with sixty-odd pounds for a useless lump of plastic and metal. But if it really did work, he could be quids in. Thousands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gizmo, as Mr. Singh called it, looked pretty basic in construction, a pocket-sized black box with two retractable antennas fitted to one end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No money had changed hands yet, so the guy had nothing to gain by doing a runner. Danny stepped out of the little coffee shop and did exactly as suggested. Walked to<br>the Mercedes, unlocked, got in, closed the door, opened it again, stepped out, locked, using the smart key, and walked back to where Mr. Singh was standing outside the shop with the gizmo in his hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You locked it, right?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure did,&#x201d; Danny said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where is key?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Back in my pocket.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Excellent. Leave it there. Now go to car and try door.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny had walked only a few steps when he saw that the lock pins were showing. Just as promised, the car was unlocked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was impressed. To be certain, he opened the door he&#x2019;d apparently locked a moment ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good job, eh?&#x201d; Mr. Singh said when Danny went back to him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nice one. Who makes these things?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Made in China.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you know it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Simple to operate. You want to buy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How does it work?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay. You know how key fob works?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Using a radio signal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right. Sending signal from fob to car. Programmed to connect with your car and no other. But this gizmo is signal jammer. Breaks frequency. You think you lock up, but I zap you with this.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let me see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny held the thing and turned it over. &#x201c;All I have to do is press this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Correct. All about timing. You are catching exact moment when driver is pointing fob at car.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hang on. There&#x2019;s always a sound when the locks engage. And the lights flick on and off. If that doesn&#x2019;t happen, the driver will notice.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you notice?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny hesitated. &#x201c;There was traffic noise and I was thinking of other things.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So?&#x201d; Mr. Singh flashed his teeth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In a quiet place the driver would notice.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t use in quiet place. Street is better, street with much traffic.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny turned the jammer over and looked at the other side, speculating. &#x201c;How much are you asking?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Seventy, battery included.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made a sound as if he&#x2019;d been burnt. &#x201c;Seventy is more than I thought.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fully effective up to fifty metres.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny handed it back. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose it works with the latest models.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Now I am being honest. Very new cars, possibly no. Manufacturers getting wise. Any car up to last year is good. That gives plenty choice. To you, special offer, not to be repeated. Sixty-five.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny took a wad from his back pocket, peeled off three twenties and held them out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Singh sighed, took the money and handed over the jammer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Before you go,&#x201d; Danny said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else. This gets me into the car, but it doesn&#x2019;t let me drive it away. I was told you have another little beauty for that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Singh&#x2019;s eyes lit up again. &#x201c;Programmer. Which make? BMW, Mercedes, Audi?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I need a different one for each make, do I? How much will it cost me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two hundred. Maybe two fifty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny whistled. This was getting to be a larger investment than he planned, but he thought about the top-class cars he could steal. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say the Bimmer.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;BMW three or five series I can do for two hundred.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is it difficult to operate?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Dead easy. All cars now have diagnostic connector port. You plug in and programmer reads key code.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then what?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Code is transferred from car&#x2019;s computer to microchip in new key. You get five blank keys gratis as well.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So I can drive off using the new key? Have you tried this yourself?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, no, no, I am supplier only. Supplying is lawful. Driving off with some person&#x2019;s car is not.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But you can show me how the thing works?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You come back with two hundred cash this time tomorrow and for you as special customer I am supplying and demonstrating BMW three series programmer.&#x201d;<br>Next afternoon special customer Danny drove away from Brighton with the programmer and the pride of a man at the cutting edge of the electronic revolution. In his youth he&#x2019;d used a wire coat hanger to get into cars. He&#x2019;d graduated to a slim Jim strip and then a whole collection of lock-picking tools. But the days of hotwiring the ignition were long gone. In recent years anti-theft technology had become so sophisticated that he&#x2019;d been reduced to touring car parks looking for vehicles left unlocked by their stupid owners. For a man once known as Driveaway Danny it had become humiliating. The Mercedes he was driving was twelve years old. He&#x2019;d liberated it in July from some idiot in Bognor who&#x2019;d left it on his driveway with the key in the ignition.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything was about to change.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would shortly be driving a BMW 3 series.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t easy to nail one. For more than a week he patrolled the streets of the south coast town of Littlehampton (which isn&#x2019;t known for executive cars) with his two gizmos in a Tesco carrier bag. The new technology called for a whole new mindset. He wasn&#x2019;t on the lookout for a parked car, but one that happened to drive up while he was watching. He&#x2019;d need to make a snap decision when the chance came. <i>If</i> the chance came.<br><br>Late Sunday evening it did. After a day of no success he was consoling himself with a real ale at his local, the Steam Packet, near the red footbridge over the River Arun. He lived in a one-bedroom flat a few hundred yards away and liked to wind down here at the end of a long day. The pub was said to have existed since 1840, trading under a different name, because the cross-channel ferry that departed from there hadn&#x2019;t come into service until 1863. <i>Welcome Aboard the Steam Packet,</i> announced the large wooden board attached to the front with a profile of a paddle steamer&#x2014;and in case the maritime message was overlooked, the north side of the pub had a ship&#x2019;s figurehead of a topless blonde (in the best possible taste, with strategically dangling curls) projecting from the wall. With a little imagination when seated in the terrace at the back overlooking River Road and the Arun you could believe yourself afloat. This was a favourite spot of Danny&#x2019;s, nicely placed for seeing spectacular sunsets or watching small boats chugging back from sea trips. But at this moment, alone in the half-light at one of the benches around 9:30 on a September evening, his thoughts were not about sea trips or sunsets. He&#x2019;d just decided he&#x2019;d wasted his money on Mr. Singh&#x2019;s gizmos. How ironic then that this was the moment when a silver BMW drove up and came to a halt in the parking space across the street.</p><h2>Writings of the Desert Fathers &amp; Mothers (Upper Room Spiritual Classics)</h2><p>For nearly 2,000 years, Christian mystics, martyrs, and sages have documented their search for the divine. Their writings have bestowed boundless wisdom upon subsequent generations. But they have also burdened many spiritual seekers.

Blood was everywhere&#x2014;the stretcher, the concrete underneath. It had poured like a river out of him and had run in a thin red line down the gutter. The EMTs had had to drain out the poison and infuse him with as much fresh, untainted blood as quickly as they could.</p><p>Julian didn&#x2019;t know what it was, the thing that had happened to him. He wasn&#x2019;t like Xavier. He wasn&#x2019;t especially introspective or philosophical. He was most comfortable with taking action.</p><p>Whatever it was, his reaction ran deep. It felt like something essential had broken inside him.</p><p>His patience, maybe.</p><p>Yeah, that was pretty much broken all to hell and back.</p><p>Xavier gazed up at him, his young-looking face drawn with pain. His eyes still leaked crimson at the corners. While he had passed the danger point, or &#x201c;magic hour&#x201d; as the EMTs called it, the brodifacoum would make every joint and muscle in his body ache for the next three weeks, as his immune system worked to rid itself of any remnant of the poison.</p><p>Mindful of that, Julian kept his hand gentle as he touched Xavier&#x2019;s shoulder, when all he really wanted to do was grab the other man and clench him in a bear hug.</p><p>No, he wasn&#x2019;t ready to live in a world without Xavier in it. For too many decades to count, Xavier had been his Jiminy Cricket and the one example Julian could always look to whenever he wondered what it meant to be a fine man.</p><p>He spared a quick glance for Tess, the human woman who hovered so protectively near Xavier&#x2019;s dark head. When Julian had first seen Tess at the Vampyre&#x2019;s Ball, she had been rigid with terror and antipathy. Now as she gazed at Xavier, her expression was filled with so much love, Julian felt as if he was witnessing something naked and profound.</p><p>Cynically, he wondered just how long that would last. Weeks, or months?</p><p>Even if her feelings lasted for a few years, what concerned him most was that Xavier looked at Tess with the same expression.</p><p>Xavier didn&#x2019;t fall in love lightly or as a passing fancy. He would not stop loving Tess after a few fleeting years, and she had made no secret of the fact that she had serious issues with Vampyres.</p><p>However, any potential outcome of their liaison was an issue to be confronted on another day. Right now, Tess looked more than happy to look after Xavier, which was all that mattered, because Julian had a traitor to hunt down, and he needed to focus all his attention on the task.</p><p>And he planned on enjoying every minute of it.</p><p>Justine, the woman behind the assassination attempt, was an old, Powerful Vampyre and a member of the Nightkind council. For years, Justine had been undermining him, quietly and sometimes not so quietly sabotaging all of his attempts to genuinely unite the council members. Trying to kill Xavier was just her latest gambit&#x2014;but this time, with her attacking a Nightkind government official, Julian was fiercely glad she had finally gone too far.</p><p>This time, he thought, I&#x2019;m going to destroy you, and every one of your co-conspirators, even if they sit on the Nightkind council too.</p><p>It was time for him to clean house, and if his hands got a little dirty in the process, why then, so be it. The Roman politician and philosopher Cicero, who had lived and died two hundred years before Julian, had once said, &#x201c;Laws are silent in times of war.&#x201d;</p><p>If that was true, so too was Julian&#x2019;s threadbare, incomplete conscience.</p><p>As he strode toward his black Jaguar, he ran through the names of the twelve who sat on the council. Of all the members, he trusted Dominic the most.</p><p>The other Vampyre had been a Norman lord under William the Conqueror, and had run one of the most successful mercenary companies in Europe during the Middle Ages.</p><p>He was calculating, calm in a crisis, and along with another council member, Marged, he was also the most neutral of all the council members. Unlike Marged, whose main abilities lay in commerce, Dominic knew how to respond when situations escalated to violence.</p><p>Pulling out his cell phone, Julian dialed Dominic&#x2019;s number.</p><p>Just when he thought the call would roll to voicemail, the ringing stopped and Dominic&#x2019;s deep baritone voice sounded. &#x201c;Good evening, Julian.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; Julian asked.</p><p>Despite his terseness, the other Vampyre&#x2019;s voice remained courteous and neutral. &#x201c;At home. Why?&#x201d;</p><p>Sliding into the driver&#x2019;s seat of his car, Julian did some quick calculations. Dominic&#x2019;s estate lay in Napa Valley, a couple of hours&#x2019; drive away, but the other Vampyre had a helicopter and could make the trip to Evenfall much quicker if necessary. That, however, was assuming Dominic would be willing and able to drop everything and come at a moment&#x2019;s notice.</p><p>Starting his car, Julian headed for his house in Nob Hill. While the great, hulking Norman-style castle Evenfall was the Nightkind King&#x2019;s official residence, it lay in Marin County across the Golden Gate Bridge. For the sake of convenience, Julian also owned a house in the city, a nineteenth-century mansion that was located not far from Xavier&#x2019;s own townhome.</p><p>As he negotiated through the heavy traffic around the site of the attack, Julian told the other man, &#x201c;Justine tried to have Xavier assassinated tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>A brief, intense silence took over the other end of the connection. Then Dominic said, &#x201c;Tried?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He survived, along with one of his attendants, but he&#x2019;ll be incapacitated for a few weeks.&#x201d; Julian&#x2019;s voice turned savage. &#x201c;It was brodifacoum poisoning.&#x201d;</p><p>The other Vampyre drew in a breath, the quiet, telltale reaction as strong as a curse. &#x201c;Do you have proof that it was Justine who tried to kill him?&#x201d;</p><p>Dominic&#x2019;s neutral tone was beginning to grate on Julian. He growled, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you don&#x2019;t believe what I&#x2019;m saying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Dominic said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to ascertain what you know, and whether or not you have enough to take to the council.&#x201d;</p><p>Fuck the council.</p><p>Julian caught himself up before he said it aloud. Instead, he replied between his teeth, &#x201c;I have two surviving witnesses.&#x201d;</p><p>Dominic said, &#x201c;I realize you&#x2019;re very angry. If someone tried to murder one of my progeny, I would be too, but think for a minute. While Xavier&#x2019;s integrity is well known, the council won&#x2019;t accept testimony from either him or his attendant. Attendants can be spelled into believing something is true when it isn&#x2019;t, and as your progeny, Xavier would have to say anything you compelled him to.&#x201d;</p><p>The fact that Dominic&#x2019;s cool reasoning was correct made Julian even angrier. He snapped, &#x201c;Goddammit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All I&#x2019;m trying to point out is that you&#x2019;re going to need more than just their stories,&#x201d; Dominic told him. &#x201c;But never mind that for now&#x2014;what actually happened?&#x201d;</p><p>Julian yanked his unruly emotions back under control. &#x201c;Justine bribed one of Xavier&#x2019;s attendants in order to get him into the city. If everyone had been killed in the attack, there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any witnesses at all. Xavier nearly did die. If his one surviving attendant hadn&#x2019;t known what needed to be done when he&#x2019;d been poisoned and taken such quick action, he <i>would</i> have died.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Justine now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s what I need to find out.&#x201d; Julian pulled in front of the black wrought iron gates to his house and keyed in the security code. As the gate swung open, he told the other man, &#x201c;Maybe going after Xavier was an end play for Justine. She&#x2019;s certainly held a grudge against him for long enough. But maybe assassinating him was just the first step in a broader agenda, and maybe Justine wasn&#x2019;t the only Vampyre involved. I need to track her down, and I need for you to get to Evenfall as quickly as you can to keep things stable while I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d;</p><p>If Xavier had been killed, his loss would have indisputably weakened Julian&#x2019;s political position even further. Setting aside the friendship factor, not only would Julian have lost his staunchest supporter in the Nightkind government, but he would have also lost his spymaster and most reliable source of information.</p><p>Dominic said, &#x201c;I need some time to wrap up some personal matters, but I can be in Evenfall by tomorrow evening. Will that be soon enough?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;ll be in touch when I know something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be smart, Julian. Use your head. Justine has allies. Whether or not you find her, just make sure you bring back proof that you can take in front of the whole council, enough so that even her allies would have to back down. That way, if nothing else, you can see that she&#x2019;s discredited and removed from office.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear what you&#x2019;re saying,&#x201d; Julian said. Finally, for the first time in their conversation, he achieved a semblance of equanimity.</p><p>He did, in fact, hear exactly what Dominic was saying&#x2014;and not saying. Dominic knew very well Julian had no intention of bringing Justine back to Evenfall, and he was warning him to get all his ducks in a row. It was sound advice.</p><p>With a punch of a thumb, Julian disconnected the call. As soon as the gate opened wide, he gunned his car down the short, curving driveway and braked in front of the huge, sprawling mansion.</p><p>The building had a hint of European flair. Built out of golden limestone, it had tall, stately windows trimmed in black iron. Alerted by the house security system, Gregoire, Julian&#x2019;s majordomo, opened the double front doors and stood waiting attentively, his intelligent, plain features impassive.</p><p>As Julian jogged up the front steps, he was already dialing another number.</p><p>Evenfall&#x2019;s IT administrator, Gavin, answered on the first ring. &#x201c;Yes, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>Julian nodded at Gregoire as he swept past. He said to Gavin, &#x201c;I want Evenfall on a total information lockdown within the next ten minutes&#x2014;five if you can manage it. No Internet, no cell phone reception. The only lines of communication I want open are the dedicated phone lines under our control. Got it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Gavin sounded somber and unsettled. &#x201c;But I have to warn you, I might not be able to make the lockdown total.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Julian raced up the stairs to his suite.</p><p>&#x201c;These days, a lot of people have independent Internet access with hotspots in their cell phones,&#x201d; Gavin said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any control over shutting those down. Evenfall is a big place, but I can see about putting out enough interference to scramble their signals.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do that until you receive further instructions from either me, Xavier or Dominic.&#x201d; He disconnected and dialed his head of security, Yolanthe. When she answered, he told her, &#x201c;Two things. I&#x2019;m putting Evenfall on a lockdown. Until further notice, nobody is allowed to enter the castle walls or leave, except for Dominic, who will be arriving tomorrow evening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; Yolanthe said. Unlike Gavin, she sounded calm to the point of sleepy. &#x201c;And the other thing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want a strike team to meet me here in the city,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Keep it lean and mean, no more than ten fighters. Get them here as soon as you can.&#x201d;</p><p>That woke her up. Sounding very alert, she said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll grab a chopper and be with you in twenty minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Twenty minutes. Thinking quickly, Julian did some math.</p><p>It had taken him fifteen minutes to navigate through city traffic to get to the house from the alley where Xavier had almost died. Before that, Julian had spent some time on the scene, waiting to hear if Xavier would survive and questioning various officials who had been first responders. And it had also taken him time to get to San Francisco from Marin County.</p><p>How long ago had he kicked Justine out of Evenfall?</p><p>Even though the Nightkind political season was over for the year, Justine had been insisting upon reconvening the council. She had claimed that Xavier had exceeded his authority when he had made this year&#x2019;s trade agreements with the Light Fae heir Melisande.</p><p>As always when Julian&#x2019;s thoughts turned to Melly, a hard knot of old pain and anger tightened in his chest.</p><p>She had once meant the world to him, and the affair they had begun so lightly in defiance of all convention had quickly turned into something much more serious. The kind of serious where a man started thinking of ways to change his life in order to be with the woman he cared about.</p><p>At least it had for him. Clearly it hadn&#x2019;t for her, or she would never have betrayed him with the Elven heir Ferion.</p><p>The whole thing had happened decades ago, in the 1990s, and time wasn&#x2019;t the only thing that had moved on. Melly and Ferion&#x2019;s affair hadn&#x2019;t lasted either. Just recently, Ferion had become the Elven lord of his demesne, while Melly still lived the carefree life of a rich, jet-setting single.</p><p>Virtually everyone had gotten on with their lives, except for him. Some part of him still remained frozen in that terrible moment of realization when he had stared at the photos of Melly and Ferion together.</p><p>Now, every time he saw her photo online or in the papers, he snarled and snapped like a wounded tiger at anyone who had the misfortune to be in the vicinity. He couldn&#x2019;t even summon a pretense of indifference. Whenever he was forced to be in the same room as Melly, any attempt at conversation quickly devolved into a shouting match.</p><p>Their troubled dynamic made it even more difficult to understand why Melly&#x2019;s mother, Tatiana, had sent Melly to conduct this year&#x2019;s trade negotiations with the Nightkind&#x2014;unless Xavier was right, and Justine had been behind that ploy too. Julian and Melly had flamed out as usual, and none of the trade agreements had been approved until Xavier had stepped in and talked to Melly personally.</p><p>When Justine had tried to claim the agreements weren&#x2019;t valid, Xavier had outmaneuvered her once again by recording Julian and Melly in verbal agreement with each other. Julian had confronted Justine with the recording, and she had left Evenfall just after sunset.</p><p>Now Julian reexamined things in a different light.</p><p>With the Nightkind political season over, the council had already met and disbanded for the year.

He rose from the undistinguished rank of quartermaster to command the Union cavalry at the battles of Yellow Tavern (where he defeated his flamboyant rebel counterpart, J.E.B. Stuart) and Winchester. And when the Civil War was over, General Phil Sheridan continued to fight, whether that meant plunging into the bloody and byzantine politics of Reconstruction Louisiana or managing the inglorious war against the Plains Indians.<br><br>This outstanding biography restores Sheridan to his place in American military history; examines his relationships with contemporaries like Grant, Sherman, and his ill-fated subordinate George Armstrong Custer, and makes the momentous age he lived in come back to life.</p><p>"Morris writes with precise elegance and an acute sense of irony..He navigates each battlefield as deftly with a pen as Phil Sheridan ever did on horseback." -- Milwaukee Journal<p>"Polished, accessible." -- The New York Times Book Review</p>A vigorous biography of the pugnacious Civil War general and Indian fighter, affectionately called ``Little Phil''--behind his back. The Union cavalry leader who rallied his seemingly routed Army of the Shenandoah with an electrifying ride back to the front at the Battle of Cedar Creek, Sheridan (as detailed by Morris, editor of the magazine America's Civil War) emerges as supremely competent if not always likable. Unlike his superiors Grant and Sherman, Sheridan served in uniform without interruption for his entire adult life, rising from lowly origins as the son of an indigent Irish-Catholic immigrant to become commander of America's army. Gruff, combative, at times ruthless, he was, Morris explains, uncomfortable in postwar roles as military supervisor of Texas and Louisiana and as the politically incorrect destroyer of Western tribes (though his oft-quoted ``the only good Indian is a dead Indian'' may be apocryphal). Nor was he perfect in battle, as evidenced in lapses at Perryville and Chickamauga and in dragging his heels in destroying Lee's army after the Shenandoah campaign. Yet, unlike his subordinate, the dashing but foolhardy George Armstrong Custer, Sheridan, Morris demonstrates, was as deliberate and careful as he was brave. A master of detail since his days as a teenaged stock clerk and young quartermaster, he ensured that he led a force that was well supplied, effectively outnumbering and concentrated against the enemy, and thoroughly briefed by scouts and spies. His self-confident battlefield magnetism appealed both to the common soldier and to mentors such as Grant and Lincoln's chief of staff Henry Halleck. A pungent, authoritative, and convincing portrait of the bantam cadet who became one of the Civil War's giants.

She later moved from France to America, settling in New York City, and started a career creating textile designs for such designers as Bill Blass and Oscar de la Renta. She also taught the theory and practice of color fundamentals at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Bijou became a full-time writer and illustrator of children&#39;s books in 1976, and since then has written and illustrated over twenty books for children. Bijou&#39;s latest book is A Bird or Two: A Story About Henri Matisse. She is currently living in Sag Harbor, New York, and working on a picture book about Marc Chagall.Le Tord here does for Matisse what she did for Claude Monet in A Blue Butterfly: she bends her watercolor style to incorporate suggestions of Matisse's famous works, and her scant, poetic text tells readers just enough to kindle an appreciation for Matisse's genius. The artist is already old and accomplished when he is introduced here, newly arrived in Nice and influenced by the extraordinary light. His colors change; his friends say, "He paints/ the sunshine/ everyday./.../ He works/ joyfully,/ with a light/ heart." Le Tord's sun-steeped art brings out that lightness of heart: her portraits of Matisse radiate his happiness and sense of play. While her versions of his paintings are more a blending of her style and his (as opposed to imitation), they capture Matisse's optimism. She doesn't give much in the way of facts (not even saying where, exactly, Nice is located), but when she declares that "Matisse/ made us/ 'hear'/ with our/ eyes/ the music/ he painted/ in his/ pictures," her meaning comes through loud and clearAthere is music in her work, too.

First love. First heartbreak. At once romantic and devastating, brutally honest and full of humor, this graphic-novel memoir is a debut of the rarest sort.</b><br><br>Maggie Thrash has spent basically every summer of her fifteen-year-old life at the one-hundred-year-old Camp Bellflower for Girls, set deep in the heart of Appalachia.

A split-second of innocent physical contact pulls Maggie into a gut-twisting love for an older, wiser, and most surprising of all (at least to Maggie), female counselor named Erin. But Camp Bellflower is an impossible place for a girl to fall in love with another girl, and Maggie&#x2019;s savant-like proficiency at the camp&#x2019;s rifle range is the only thing keeping her heart from exploding. When it seems as if Erin maybe feels the same way about Maggie, it&#x2019;s too much for both Maggie and Camp Bellflower to handle, let alone to understand.</p><p><b>Maggie Thrash</b> is a staff writer for <i>Rookie,</i> a popular online magazine for teenage girls.

An insightful and thought-provoking work.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>Thrash writes with an intoxicating mix of candor, irony, and fresh passion. Much of the memoir&#x2019;s piquancy comes from the collisions between the camp&#x2019;s ideal of Southern womanhood, the campers&#x2019; clannishness, and Maggie&#x2019;s faith in herself as she becomes, incongruously, the camp&#x2019;s best rifle shot. This is the kind of memoir that stays with readers for days.<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>Thrash's unvarnished retelling of her adolescent experience is neither glamourizing nor self-deprecating&#x2014;and the salty realism makes the story engrossing and quite funny.

It sounds sad, but Thrash keeps it from being depressing with her lively story and honesty.<br>&#x2014;Book Riot (blog)</p><h2>Digging for Richard III: The Search for the Lost King</h2><p><p><strong>"As gripping as any detective fiction. Proof that one doesn't need to be fascinated with Richard III to be enthralled by the story of his body's discovery."&nbsp;&#x2015;<em>Publisher's Weekly</em></strong></p> In August 2012 a search began, and on February 4, 2013, a team from Leicester University delivered its verdict to a mesmerized press room and to the world: they had found the remains of Richard III, whose legacy was perhaps the most contested of all British monarchs.<br><br> Prior to this major discovery, there had been little new information about Richard III for some time. With no new evidence to fuel it, the debate over what kind of man he might have been seemed to have stalled. Thus the story of the discovery of Richard III is a story of the value of archaeology&#x2015;careful analysis of physical evidence backed up by the latest science and technology&#x2015;and how it can change our understanding of history. Firsthand accounts from the team that found the king, along with photographs from the author&#x2019;s own archives and an expanded epilogue incorporating new DNA evidence, augment this compelling detective story as the evidence is uncovered. 43 illustrations</p><p>Mike Pitts has been the editor of British Archaeology, Britain&#x2019;s leading archaeology magazine, for over fifteen years, following and reporting on an extraordinary number of discoveries and scientific breakthroughs. He is an award-winning journalist and archaeologist who has researched subjects ranging from Easter Island to Stonehenge.&#x201c;Highly recommended. [Mike] Pitts effectively conveys the excitement of the discovery, clearly and vividly describing the process and the personalities.

He notes how in the natural world, a seed becomes a sprout, which produces a flower, which bears fruit. A seed has no intention to sprout; when the right conditions are assembled the fruit arises. Similarly, when our senses encounter an object, a sense consciousness arises naturally, without our intending it. This, says the Buddha, is also how karma works and how actions performed out of ignorance create suffering, whether we want it or not. And this same law of causality also governs enlightenment&#x2014;when the right conditions are assembled, awakening is assured.<br> <br> In many sutras like this one, the Buddha explains that to understand his Dharma is to understand dependent arising. Geshe Yeshe Thabkhe explores dependent arising, and the corollary teaching of emptiness, &nbsp;through this sutra and others. Commenting on the works of Indian masters such as Shantaraksita, he shows how belief in a creator god is incompatible with dependent arising, and by illuminating the teachings of Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti, he shows how we do&#x2014;and do not&#x2014;exist.<br> <br> Geshe Yeshe Thabkhe was among the last generation of scholars to be trained in Tibet before the Chinese occupation. He has been teaching Westerners for decades, having worked with top scholars in the United States, and he is especially familiar with this sutra, having translated the commentary by Kamalasila into Hindi. Here his deep familiarity, combined with his extensive command of the Buddhist scriptures, allows him to present the Buddha&#x2019;s words in a rich and authoritative context.</p><p>Professor Geshe Yeshe Thabkhe was born in 1930 in Lhokha, Central Tibet, and became a monk of Drepung Loseling Monastery at the age of thirteen. After completing his studies in 1969, Geshe Thabkhe was awarded the highest academic degree offered in the Geluk school of Tibetan Buddhism. Since 1972, he has served as Professor of the Indian Tradition of Buddhist Philosophy at Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, the only Tibetan university in India. He has also served as a lecturer at the School of Buddhist Philosophy, Leh, Ladakh, and at Sanskrit University in Sarnath. His works include Hindi translations of Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s <i>Essence of Good Explanation of the Definitive and Interpretable</i> and Kamalasila&#x2019;s commentary on the <i>Rice Seedling Sutra</i>. He was the primary traditional source for the English translation of Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s <i>Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path</i>. He is a resident teacher at The Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center in New Jersey and has also taught at Drepung Loseling in Georgia, Jewel Heart in Michigan, and Sravasti Abbey in Washington State.</p><h2>The Free: A Novel</h2><p><p>Award-winning author of <em>The Motel Life</em>, <em>Northline</em> and <em>Lean on Pete</em>, Willy Vlautin demonstrates his extraordinary talent for confronting issues facing modern America, illuminated through the lives of three memorable characters who are looking for a way out of their financial, familial, and existential crises in <em>The Free</em>.</p><p>While serving in Iraq, veteran Leroy Kervin suffered a traumatic brain injury.

Led by General Titus, the son of Emperor Vespasian, the Roman army completed its mission of destruction on the ninth day of Av (August) in AD 70.<br><br>The glorious Temple, built by King Herod, was the second of the sacred Temples to stand on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The First Temple had been built by King Solomon around 1000 BC and was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The Second Temple, built initially by the Jews after their return to Jerusalem in 536 BC following the Babylonian captivity and then expanded by Herod in the first century, remains in ruins today. However, exciting developments are taking place in Israel that will result in a Third Temple being built on the ancient foundations that Solomon put in place more than three thousand years ago. <br><br>You and I are part of the generation that will live to see a Temple of God once again stand in Jerusalem, the spiritual crossroads of the world.<br><br>The rebuilding of the Temple holds profound prophetic significance, equal to the appearance of the Antichrist or the forming of the pagan armies to invade Israel in the coming War of Gog and Magog. While many students of biblical prophecy have debated the role that will be played by the Third Temple in end-times developments, the Scriptures make it clear that just before Christ returns, the Third Temple of God must stand again on the original location on the Temple Mount.<br><br>Preparations to rebuild the Temple have progressed on several fronts, with plans already in place that go into far greater detail than most people are aware of. The Temple project is yet another major prophetic signpost on the time line leading to the final conflict of the battle of Armageddon and the establishment of the kingdom of God. No less a prophet than Jesus Christ made it clear that the generation that witnessed the return of the Jews to the Promised Land would live to see Him return to earth. The modern State of Israel was born in 1948, which means that you and I are part of the last-days generation (see Matthew 24:32&#x2014;34). <br><br>However, the Temple must once again occupy its place on the Temple Mount before the major prophesied events of the last days can take place.<br><br>Many scholars have questioned whether the Temple will ever be rebuilt because of the immense practical, religious, and political obstacles that stand in the way. Mosques, shrines, and other Muslim holy sites occupy the Temple Mount, a thirty-five acre site that is under the administrative control of Arab authorities. Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel has controlled the entire city of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount. However, Israel allows the Supreme Muslim Religious Council (the Waqf ) to control religious activities and to police (without firearms) all activities on the Temple Mount. This area is the location of the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Religious Jews do not worship in the area of the Dome of the Rock because the chief rabbis warn they might inadvertently trespass on the site of the ancient Holy of Holies. Muslim control of the Temple Mount fulfills the prophecy of Luke 21:24, that &#x201c;Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.&#x201d;<br><br>In addition to the political and religious tensions that stand in the way of rebuilding the Temple, a longstanding and seemingly unsolvable dilemma from within Judaism has presented a major obstacle. The Jews cannot rebuild the Temple or resume worship in the Temple unless the long-dormant Sanhedrin Court, the highest body of Jewish lawmakers, is reconvened. This is necessary in order to reestablish the Levitical priesthood. The Sanhedrin is the only religious body authorized to determine the correct location of the Temple, to reinstitute the ancient rituals, and to oversee the many details related to Temple ritual and worship.<br><br>One of Jesus&#x2019; prophecies indicates that the Sanhedrin will indeed be fulfilling its duties in the last days. Christ warned His disciples about the coming persecution in Jerusalem during the Tribulation. He told them to pray that their flight from the city would not be &#x201c;on the sabbath day&#x201d; (Matthew 24:20). <br><br>The reason for this is the commandment against performing work on the sabbath (see Exodus 20:8&#x2014;10). The ancient Sanhedrin had determined that any travel on the sabbath that exceeded one thousand paces was considered work. However, if an invasion force should attack on the sabbath and the Jews in Jerusalem limited their travel to one thousand paces, it could ensure their destruction. Christ&#x2019;s prophecy implies that the Sanhedrin will exist in the last days and will have the authority to enforce such a religious rule. The historian Flavius Josephus calculated the distance from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives, known popularly as &#x201c;the sabbath&#x2019;s day journey,&#x201d; as approximately one thousand yards.<br><br>Interestingly, the gospel historian Luke wrote in the book of Acts that the distance from the Mount of Olives to the Temple Mount is approximately a thousand paces, a &#x201c;sabbath&#x2019;s day journey&#x201d; (1:12).<br><br><b><i>Israel without a Temple</i><br></b>With the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70, Israel lost the Temple as the center of its spiritual life (see photograph). During the nineteen centuries that followed, Jews in exile prayed for their prophesied return to the Promised Land. Every year at Passover and at the end of Yom Kippur, righteous Jews have prayed, &#x201c;Next year in Jerusalem.&#x201d; Along with that hope, religious Jews have longed to rebuild their Temple and establish the long-promised kingdom of God on earth under the rule of the long-awaited Messiah.<br><br>Over those same centuries, three times a day devout Jews living in exile have prayed that they will live to see their Temple rebuilt: &#x201c;May it be Thy will that the Temple be speedily rebuilt in our days.&#x201d;2 They looked forward to the day when the Temple would once again stand on the Temple Mount. <br><br>They longed for the Lord to return His Shekinah Glory and Divine Presence to the sanctuary in Jerusalem. Finally, after nineteen centuries, today&#x2019;s generation has been given the task of making these ancient dreams come true.<br><br><b><i>God&#x2019;s Command to Build a Sanctuary<br></i></b>The rebuilding of the Temple is central to the messianic hopes of the Jewish people. As the rabbis have noted, God never rescinded His command that Israel build a sanctuary for Him (see Exodus 25:8). Therefore, His command remains in force today. <br><br>The Lord gave Moses the precise blueprint to follow in constructing His earthly sanctuary, the movable Tabernacle that Israel used prior to the building of the First Temple. The sacred vessels and worship instruments that later were used in Solomon&#x2019;s Temple, including the ark of the covenant.<i><br></i><br>Likewise, God revealed to King David and his son Solomon the detailed plans for building a permanent Temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. Solomon&#x2019;s Temple was destroyed in 586 BC. The Second Temple, initially completed in 516 BC and totally refurnished and enlarged by King Herod beginning in 18 BC, was destroyed as well, in AD 70. Yet Jesus mentioned the existence of &#x201c;the holy place&#x201d; in a future Temple when He told His disciples about the events of the last days and the Great Tribulation.<br><br>He warned that &#x201c;when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains&#x201d; (Matthew 24:15&#x2014;16). Jesus&#x2019; prophecy echoed that of the prophet Daniel, who indicated that the &#x201c;abomination that maketh desolate&#x201d; would stand in the Temple of God in Jerusalem (see Daniel 11:31; 12:11). Both prophecies suggest that the Third Temple will be built before the Antichrist comes to power and takes control of Europe and the surrounding Mediterranean nations.<br><br>Satan will spiritually defile the Holy Place of the rebuilt Temple by directing his Antichrist to violate the Holy of Holies at the beginning of the last three and a half years of the Tribulation. The False Prophet, the Antichrist&#x2019;s partner, will then demand that the Antichrist be worshiped as &#x201c;god&#x201d; in the rebuilt Temple.<br><br><b><i>Controversy over Rebuilding the Temple<br></i></b>Among the ongoing tragedies of the Middle East is that both Arabs and Jews claim the right of possession of the Holy Land, the city of Jerusalem, and the Temple Mount. In just about any current news report involving the conflict between Israel and its Arab enemies, the ancient, walled Old City of Jerusalem plays a prominent role. God told His prophets thousands of years ago that the final battle for the soul and destiny of mankind will be decided in Jerusalem, whose name literally means &#x201c;city of peace,&#x201d; the city where the coming Messiah will establish His eternal throne.<br><br>The Third Temple will be built on what is the most passionately contested piece of real estate on earth. Not only is this rebuilding prophesied in Scripture, but today rabbis, researchers, archaeologists, and other interested parties are drawing up detailed architectural plans, re-creating precious vessels to be used in Temple worship, and searching for the lost treasures of the ancient Temple. Incredible progress has been made recently in locating, gathering, and in some cases re-creating the necessary vessels, utensils, and other sacred objects that will be necessary to reinstate sacred worship and animal sacrifice.<br><br>Key figures of the Orthodox Jewish leadership in Israel have finally thrown their support behind the many efforts currently under way to prepare for building the Third Temple. The progress, extent, and timing of these preparations will be examined in later chapters of this book.<br><br><b><i>Control of the Temple Mount<br></i></b>After Israel&#x2019;s stunning victory over the Arab armies during the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israeli defense minister General Moshe Dayan went to the Al-Aqsa Mosque to meet with the five leaders of the Supreme Muslim Religious Council. The council had exercised control over the Temple Mount during nearly twenty years of Jordanian military control of the eastern portion of Jerusalem, from Israel&#x2019;s 1948 War of Independence until the Six-Day War. The meeting between Dayan and the Muslim leaders established Israel&#x2019;s religious and political policy concerning the Temple Mount, a policy that remains unchanged today. Dayan, a nonreligious Jew, did not appreciate the profound historical and spiritual significance of the Temple Mount and thus relinquished administrative control to the Arabs. He hoped the generosity of this gesture would be appreciated. Unfortunately, they interpreted it as an indication of the weakness of Israel&#x2019;s resolve to possess and hold their holiest place of worship, the Temple Mount.<br><br>Dayan ordered the Israeli flag that Jewish soldiers had affixed to the golden dome removed from the Dome of the Rock. His further concessions surrendered administrative control of the Temple Mount to the Supreme Muslim Religious Council, a Jordanian-controlled Muslim trust known as the Waqf. Though Jews would be permitted limited access to the Temple Mount area, all prayer or reading of Scripture by Jews and Christians was prohibited.<br><br>The Temple Mount remains at the center of Israeli-Arab tensions, with Arab authorities continuing to exercise administrative control over Israel&#x2019;s most sacred site. However, God has called on His people to rebuild the Temple. Not only is this critical development commanded by God, but the Scriptures reveal that the Temple will be rebuilt before the Messiah returns to earth.<br><br>In the chapters that follow, we will look not only at the advancing plans and preparations to rebuild the Temple, but also at a number of closely related developments, such as the training of Levite priests, the recovery of long-lost Temple treasures, developments in locating the ark of the covenant and returning it to Jerusalem, and the discovery of ancient vessels and artifacts that are required for Temple sacrifice and worship. With a new Sanhedrin Court now in place, with some five hundred Levites being trained in the requirements of Temple animal sacrifice, and with critical lost treasures from the Second Temple being located and returned to Jerusalem, it is no longer just a dream that the Temple of God will once again stand on the Temple Mount.<br><br>After nineteen centuries of praying and waiting, the Jews have finally been given the historic task of making their ancient dreams come true. The building of the Third Temple will commence much sooner than most people expect. The generation alive today will see the Temple of God once again standing in Jerusalem, and the King of Israel&#x2013;the returning Messiah&#x2013;ruling from the throne of David!</p><h2>The Wood Beyond (Dalziel and Pascoe)</h2><p>Police Inspector Peter Pascoe has stumbled upon the remains of an ancestor unjustly executed in wartime.

You&#x2019;re only eleven once.</p><p>I wiped my hands off the best I could, then let the rag fall onto the drop cloth I&#x2019;d carefully placed under the work area. I am nothing if not prepared.</p><p>But the text I&#x2019;d received was not from Melissa; it was from Detective Lieutenant Anita McElone of the Harbor Haven Police Department. My breath stopped for a second. When your eleven-year-old isn&#x2019;t at home, you really don&#x2019;t want to get a call from the police. I knew McElone a little, but we weren&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;d call &#x201c;friends,&#x201d; and she&#x2019;d never contacted me out of the blue before.</p><p>The text read: &#x201c;COME OUTSIDE TO YOUR PORCH.&#x201d;</p><p>That took some of my panic away but piqued my curiosity. I looked out the window of the home theater&#x2014;therein lies a tale; it was slated to become a fitness center for the guests until I found out how much exercise equipment costs&#x2014;and sure enough, McElone was standing on the front porch next to the glider, hands clasped behind her, pacing.</p><p>I sighed. The big scaredy-cat. Lieutenant McElone, one of the most unflappable people I have ever met, is afraid to come into my house because she thinks she&#x2019;ll see a ghost. Which is silly. McElone can&#x2019;t see the ghosts who stay in my house.</p><p>Perhaps I should explain.</p><p>Melissa and I moved to Harbor Haven, the town where I grew up, about three years ago after a divorce from a man I call &#x201c;The Swine,&#x201d; although that sometimes makes me feel like I&#x2019;m insulting actual pigs. I bought the property at 123 Seafront because I wanted to start a new life for us here on the Jersey Shore, and I&#x2019;d been in the process of renovating the place when things changed after a freak&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we&#x2019;ll call it an &#x201c;accident&#x201d;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. left me with a severely bruised head, a concussion, and the ability to see ghosts. Specifically, Paul Harrison and Maxie Malone, who had been inhabiting the old Victorian since they&#x2019;d been murdered on the premises. Once they realized that I could see them, they&#x2019;d wanted me to find out who had killed them. But that&#x2019;s a story told elsewhere.</p><p>As it turned out, I was not the only member of my family who could see Paul and Maxie, though I was the only one who&#x2019;d had to sustain a head injury first. My mother and Melissa were both professional-level ghost communicators and had been keeping that little fact from me for, let&#x2019;s say all <i>my</i> life in Mom&#x2019;s case and all <i>her</i> life in Melissa&#x2019;s. But I have forgiven them. I am magnanimous. And it comes in handy now that my father has passed away. I&#x2019;m sad he&#x2019;s dead, but he&#x2019;s still around a lot. My family is an emotional roller coaster. Probably in a different way than yours.</p><p>I took a breath before heading outside to McElone. I&#x2019;d specifically chosen this moment to work on the theater because I was, for once, alone in my thoughts, something that almost <i>never</i> happens around the guesthouse. With Liss at her friend Wendy&#x2019;s and all six of my current guests out at the beach on this scorching-hot day, the only &#x201c;company&#x201d; I&#x2019;d normally have had would be the ghosts. But Maxie, who&#x2019;d recently developed the ability to leave the property, had decided to go visit her mother, and Paul, who still can&#x2019;t wander farther than my property line, had been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not upset, and not exactly broody lately, but showing signs of some ennui, which he had not explained. I decided he was a grown man&#x2014;if a dead one, which would understandably bum <i>anyone</i> out&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d let him work out his issues until he brought them up himself.</p><p>Wiping off my hands again, I walked out of the theater, down the corridor to the entrance, and opened the door. A blast of heat and humidity, which you tend to forget about when you&#x2019;re living in air-conditioning, smacked me hard in the face.</p><p>McElone wasn&#x2019;t even sweating. I&#x2019;d been exposed to the tropical wave for three seconds and was already feeling moist, but she had no human responses. She was, I had decided long before, not so much a regular person as a cop who occasionally took in air to survive.</p><p>&#x201c;This is what it&#x2019;s come to?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;You text me from my own front porch because you&#x2019;re afraid of my house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not <i>afraid</i>,&#x201d; she protested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just not interested in seeing any more than I already have.&#x201d; The lieutenant had been witness to a few of the less conventional events that take place in my house. Events that several of my guests pay good money to witness, but the novelty of it is lost on McElone.</p><p>&#x201c;You sure you don&#x2019;t want to come inside?&#x201d; I tried. &#x201c;I promise there are no ghosts around at the moment, and it&#x2019;s got to be a hundred degrees out here.&#x201d;</p><p>McElone held up a hand at the very suggestion, which made her look a little like a very imposing cigar store Indian. Cigar store Native American? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine here.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a tentative quality to her that I&#x2019;d never seen before. McElone doesn&#x2019;t actually have a sense of humor, but she&#x2019;s usually sharper in conversation than this.</p><p>Something was bothering her.</p><p>It probably would have been bothering her more if she&#x2019;d known that despite my assurances about the lack of ghosts, Paul had just risen up from the crawl space under the front porch and was watching her closely. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t call the lieutenant, did you?&#x201d; he asked, knowing full well that I wouldn&#x2019;t answer him directly with her there.</p><p>&#x201c;What brings you here, Lieutenant?&#x201d; I asked for both our sakes. &#x201c;Have there been complaints about the guesthouse again?&#x201d; Locals in Harbor Haven know the stories about the place, and I had recently installed a prominent sign, just to the left of the front door, that read proudly, &#x201c;Haunted Guesthouse,&#x201d; replacing a temporary one Melissa had made on poster board.</p><p>But occasionally the odd&#x2014;and some of them are <i>very</i> odd&#x2014;tourist or a townsperson with an especially prickly nature makes a complaint at the police station about &#x201c;weird goings-on&#x201d; or &#x201c;strange noises&#x201d; emanating from the house. None of which is actually true, since the ghosts can&#x2019;t be heard at all if you don&#x2019;t have the ear for it.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember Martin Ferry?&#x201d; McElone asked, out of nowhere.</p><p>&#x201c;Detective Ferry?&#x201d; I asked. I remembered him as a sour-natured detective in Seaside Heights, who had once reluctantly shared some information with me. We hadn&#x2019;t hit it off so much as we&#x2019;d tolerated each other. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t he your partner before you came here to Harbor Haven?&#x201d;</p><p>McElone nodded. Then she shuddered a little, bit her lip and looked like she was fighting tears. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; she said finally, forcing the words out.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Lieutenant,&#x201d; I said. I&#x2019;ve never called McElone by her name, only her rank. We don&#x2019;t have that kind of relationship. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry to hear it. Was it sudden?&#x201d; I recalled Ferry as a middle-aged man with a prodigious belly; I wondered if his heart had given out.</p><p>&#x201c;Very sudden,&#x201d; McElone answered. &#x201c;Somebody shot him.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>&#x201c;Come inside,&#x201d; I said again to McElone. I was getting really hot out on the porch. &#x201c;I promise nothing strange will happen.&#x201d; I might have said that last part a little louder than was necessary; I wanted to emphasize it to Paul. I had to admit, the heat and the news of Ferry had me just a little off balance.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the lieutenant answered. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At least sit down,&#x201d; I suggested. I have a glider on the front porch, and gestured toward it. McElone surveyed it up and down, as if trying to determine what these puny humans do on such things, but eventually sat down and let out a breath.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get myself a glass of lemonade,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Would you like one, Lieutenant?&#x201d;</p><p>McElone turned her head suddenly, as if she&#x2019;d just realized I was there. &#x201c;Yeah. Sure. Thank you.&#x201d; This <i>was</i> serious; she wasn&#x2019;t even being snide. Snide is McElone&#x2019;s baseline attitude when I&#x2019;m around.</p><p>I opened the door again and let the cool, dry air envelop me as I walked into my supposedly terrifying house. Paul slipped through the door (and when I say <i>through the door</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) and followed me, as I&#x2019;d hoped he would.</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you think she came here?&#x201d; I asked him quietly. &#x201c;She seems really shaken by what happened to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s obvious,&#x201d; the spook to my right answered. &#x201c;She wants our help in finding Detective Ferry&#x2019;s killer.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul, who&#x2019;d been a fledgling private investigator when his life was cut short on his first solo case&#x2014;guarding Maxie&#x2014;and I had an arrangement: He and Maxie would help me guarantee an interactive experience for some of my guests (those who booked through Senior Plus Tours, looking for the &#x201c;value-added&#x201d; aspect of staying in a haunted house) if I helped him. As it turns out, eternity is a long time, and being a ghost stuck within my property lines was a little dull. Paul wanted to keep his hand in the investigation biz. He&#x2019;d need &#x201c;legs&#x201d; outside the house on occasion. And since Melissa was (at the time) nine years old and Mom was not exactly as spry as she used to be, Paul chose me.</p><p>Suffice it to say that while I was not completely thrilled at the prospect of working PI cases, I <i>was</i> thrilled with the idea of guaranteed guests for my business, which is what Senior Plus assured me they&#x2019;d send if I could deliver the spooks. So after a while I&#x2019;d caved and sat for the private investigator&#x2019;s exam, Maxie reluctantly signed up for the &#x201c;spook shows,&#x201d; the guests started coming and I forgot all about my PI license until Paul started insisting that I keep my end of the bargain and actually take cases.</p><p>He can communicate with other spirits&#x2014;I call it the Ghosternet&#x2014;and he let it be known that &#x201c;we&#x201d; were open for business. So once in a while a ghost will ask him for help, and I have to go along for the ride if I want to keep my real business running. Which is also how I know Lieutenant McElone (who doesn&#x2019;t respect my detecting skills much, and she&#x2019;s right).</p><p>Now I looked at Paul carefully. &#x201c;You know, there are times when you overestimate the draw of your imaginary detective agency,&#x201d; I told him. He frowned at the word <i>imaginary</i>, but I didn&#x2019;t give him time to answer. &#x201c;McElone is a detective herself, and a good one. She doesn&#x2019;t need me&#x2014;and as far as she knows, the whole &#x2018;agency&#x2019; is me&#x2014;to help her on an investigation. She has the Harbor Haven Police Department.&#x201d;</p><p>I opened a cupboard and took out two glasses. Melissa would have been impressed that I used the actual glass ones. When it&#x2019;s just the two of us, we drink out of plastic cups I buy at the Acme. We&#x2019;re a classy family.</p><p>&#x201c;No, she doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Paul countered. &#x201c;Keep in mind, Detective Ferry was a member of the Seaside Heights department. Unless he was killed here in Harbor Haven, his case is not within the lieutenant&#x2019;s jurisdiction.&#x201d;</p><p>I went to the fridge and got out the pitcher of lemonade (which, in the interest of full disclosure, Melissa had made, following a recipe her grandmother had given her; I&#x2019;m either the world&#x2019;s worst or the least-inspired cook, depending on whether you ask me or the my mother, who&#x2019;s diplomatic to a fault) and walked to the counter.</p><p>&#x201c;I guarantee the cops in Seaside would be all over the murder of one of their own,&#x201d; I told Paul. &#x201c;Even if McElone wants to look into it herself, she has to trust them to handle it. There&#x2019;s no reason to ask me.&#x201d; I got a tray from the cabinet under the microwave oven.</p><p>Paul raised an eyebrow and put his hands into the pockets of his jeans, a sign that he was getting stubborn about something. This was different from when he&#x2019;s thinking, when he&#x2019;ll feverishly stroke his goatee. You get to know someone when they inhabit your house, even if they died before you got there.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you that the lieutenant asks you for help when you go back out to the porch,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you I&#x2019;m right.&#x201d;</p><p>I put the glasses and the pitcher on the tray and lifted it, heading for the kitchen door. (Perhaps it should be noted that this was a special favor for the lieutenant&#x2014;the guesthouse is not a bed-and-breakfast, so even my guests don&#x2019;t get more than a morning cup of coffee or tea out of me.) &#x201c;Fine for you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not like you can pay off when I win. What are you betting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I win the bet, we take the case for Lieutenant McElone,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;And when <i>I</i> win?&#x201d; We were almost to the front door.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>If</i> you were to win, we turn down the next investigation we&#x2019;re offered, and I won&#x2019;t complain about it. How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Double or nothing,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He looked puzzled. &#x201c;Double or nothing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When I win the bet, I get to turn down the next <i>two</i> cases you cook up on the Ghosternet. Deal?&#x201d;</p><p>Paul didn&#x2019;t even stop to think. &#x201c;Deal.&#x201d;</p><p>I tilted my head toward the knob on the front door. &#x201c;Do you mind?&#x201d;</p><p>Paul reached over and opened the door for me, which was a vast improvement over what he could do when I first met him (at the time, picking up a quarter was a chore requiring intense concentration). I thanked him quietly as I carried the tray back into the blast furnace.</p><p>I put the tray down on a wicker table next to the glider where McElone was still sitting, looking uncomfortable but amazingly not sweaty. I poured the two glasses and handed her one as I leaned on the railing facing her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry for your loss, Lieutenant,&#x201d; I said, and meant it. &#x201c;I know Detective Ferry was a friend, and this must hurt. I wish there were something I could do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is,&#x201d; Lieutenant McElone said. &#x201c;You can help me find out who killed Martin.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul&#x2019;s grin was so wide I swear I could see his rear molars.</p><p>I concentrated my attention not on my usual terrible luck in gambling&#x2014;I lose money driving <i>past</i> Atlantic City&#x2014;but on the woman inhabiting my glider. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; I told McElone.</p><p>Her face showed no emotion; her voice was not the least bit wavery. She looked at me with her un-sweat-stained face and said, without hesitation, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m asking you to help solve my ex-partner&#x2019;s murder. Will you do that for me?&#x201d;</p><p>Now, the fact of the matter is that bet or no bet, Paul or no Paul, I owed Anita McElone my life at least once and probably more times than that. She had been there for me at times when I most needed someone. She deserved to get what she wanted from me in her time of great need.</p><p>But what she really needed was a good detective, which I wasn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Are you sure you want me?&#x201d; I asked her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want a more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. experienced investigator?&#x201d;</p><p>McElone looked at me for a long time, so long that I started to think maybe she was staring into space, thinking of her lost friend. Maybe she was trying to bore a hole in my face with her eyes.</p><p>Then she did the oddest thing I could have imagined: She laughed.

James, Earl Lovelace's Caribbean classic tells the story of Calvary Hill - poverty stricken, pot-holed and garbage-strewn - where the slum shacks 'leap out of the red dirt and stone, thin like smoke, fragile like kite paper, balancing on their rickety pillars as broomsticks on the edge of a juggler's nose'. <b>The Dragon Can't Dance</b> is a remarkable canvas of shanty-town life in which Lovelace's intimate knowledge of rural Trinidad and the Carnival as a sustaining cultural tradition are brilliantly brought to life.</p><p>Earl Lovelace is an award-winning Trinidadian novelist, journalist, playwright, and short story writer.Caribbean writer Lovelace, whose Salt won the 1997 Commonwealth Writer's Prize, returns with a story (first published in England in 1979) that offers a defining and luminously sensitive portrait of postcolonial island life. The island in question is recently independent Trinidad, but it could be any Caribbean island settled by European planters, African slaves, and indentured East Indians. Carnival time is at hand, and the inhabitants of the Hill, former slaves, who ``survive here, holding their poverty as a possession,'' are getting ready for this Mardi Graslike celebration: Steel bands are practicing, calypso singers and writers--like the diffident Philo--are creating new songs, and Aldrick Prospect, as usual, is working on his dragon costume. Aldrick, who, like most of the men, is unemployed, comes alive at Carnival, where it's his mission to do the Dragon dance, a dance that expresses all the people's frustrations and memories of their warrior past, and affirms their power--power that, if provoked, could burn down the city. But this year Aldrick, who's spurned the advances of young Sylvia, finds himself brooding. Change is in the air--those steel bands are acquiring commercial sponsors, the old fighting spirit of the people is changing to passive acceptance, and Aldrick's friends are drifting away and making new lives. After Carnival, Aldrick, feeling like ``the last symbol of rebellion,'' continues to brood, especially when he sees Sylvia take up with Guy, a notorious womanizer. He befriends Fisheye, an angry radical, and joins a futile rebellion against the government. Aldrick is jailed but, unlike the others, doesn't accept defeat, and once released--still depressed--he returns to the Hill. Finally, a quiet epiphany and a promise of Sylvia's affection present him with hope and reason enough to give up the impotent protest of the Dragon's dance. A poignant, beautifully crafted tale about a man and his country on the cusp of change. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Facing down batter after batter, he breaks down his though process and recounts in vivid and candid detail his analysis of the players who stepped into the batter's box against him, his control of both the ball and the elements of the day, and his moments of synchronicity with teammate Tim McCarver, all the while capturing the fascinating relationship and unspoken dialogue that carries on between pitcher and catcher over the course of nine critical innings.</p><p>From the dugout to the locker room, Gibson offers a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of the players, the team's chemistry, and clubhouse culture.

Not since Bettelheim&#39;s The Uses of Enchantment has the underlying significance of fantasy and fairy tales been so insightfully and entertainingly mined.</p><p><b>Sheldon Cashdan, Ph.D.,</b> is Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He is the author of Abnormal Psychology, Interactional Psychotherapy, and Object Relations Therapy.A disappointingly disjointed attempt to elaborate on fairy tales' psychological mission. Cashdan, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, begins with general statements about fairy tales that are then contradicted in subsequent discussion. For example, the author claims that fairy tales are not faithful representations of reality, while demonstrating that they are in fact products of their time and cultural environment. Further, Cashdan finds in many fairy tales the same dynamics of power, envy, and control as exist in the workplace. He traces transformations that over time shifted the plot of some of the best-known tales, showing that the changes were induced by the mores of each particular society. In a separate line of reasoning, Cashdan declares that fairy tales were originally conceived as entertainment for adults and not to teach children any moral lesson. However, the central argument is that fairy tales address pragmatic concerns, helping children to personify and combat the reprehensible parts of their own character and emotions. Hence the central position in many fairy tales of the witch, a carrier of such deadly sins as sloth, greed, gluttony, vanity, and deceit. The witch's inevitable death at the end of the tale serves to ensure the child permanent victory over the selfs sinful side. To reinforce the effficacy of moral instruction in fairy tales, Cashdan provides suggestions on the use of specific tales in child education, and a reading guide for parents and teachers. When he ventures beyond psychology into literary and folklore studies, his analysis appears even weaker. Evidently not familiar with Vladimir Propp's seminal work, ``Morphology of the Folktale,'' which has informed folklore studies for the past 70 years, Cashdan invents his own superficial structural model of fairy tales. Most of the book merely retells well-known fairy tales, while the contradictory and confusing main argument could easily have been condensed to just a few pages. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And what if that man was a Cynster?</em></p></blockquote><p>Every girl&#x2014;even convent-educated ones&#x2014;dreams of forbidden kisses. So when a man literally falls at Helena's feet as she's walking through the courtyard one moonlit Christmas Eve, the pretty, young comtesse d'Lisle knows he's up to no good. He's clearly a bit dangerous... and obviously caught in the middle of a clandestine rendezvous. Why else would he have risked his neck and jumped out of a window into the snow?</p><p>It's wrong, it's outlandish . . . and it's the most utterly <em>romantic</em> gesture she's ever seen. So when the good sisters rush up, demanding to know ifshe has seen a man on the grounds, Helena ignores the years of strict upbringing that insist she reveal his presence.</p><p><em>To lie would be a sin, but 'no one can be good all the time.</em></p><p>As a reward for her silence, the stranger takes her in his arms and enticingly, unforgettably kisses her&#x2014;and then departs, leaving a lingering if unspoken promise of all that might be, should fate decree that they meet again. Although Helena doesn't know it, her wild Englishman is Sebastian Cynster, Duke of St. Ives, a nobleman who will prove to be her destiny.</p><p>Seven years later, Helena has been transformed from a pretty schoolgirl to an aristocratic beauty. Her sparkling wit has made her sought after by London's hostesses; her considerable dowry has made winning her hand the aim of many a gentleman . . . but she is deadeningly aware of how <em>boring</em> so many ofthese gentlemen are.</p><p>Her manipulative guardian has unexpectedly allowed her to find a husband of her own choosing, and she has no intention of marrying any man who tries to tame her. There must be someone perfect for her . . . someone who can live up to the promise ofthat long-ago kiss.</p><p>Then, at a ball, fate strikes. Once again, it is the Christmas season, and across the crowded room Helena stands transfixed . . . for there is the man whose kiss she has never forgotten, the man of her memory whom no other has ever been able to supplant. Her wild, mysterious Englishman, Sebastian Cynster, Duke of St. Ives.</p><p>One look, and he's determined to reclaim her . . . .</p></p><p>One unforgettable night, Sebastian, the Duke of St. Ives, stole a kiss from a beautiful young woman at a French convent. They didn't share their names but neither of them ever forgot the magic of that innocent kiss, and when they meet again in London seven years later, each instantly recognizes the other. Helena, the Comtesse d'Lisle, is searching for a manageable husband to thwart her controlling guardian, and Sebastian, a London rake who has sworn never to wed, is clearly not an appropriately biddable candidate.

Neale Monks and Philip Palmer look at the latest ideas on ammonite biology and ecology to present this detailed picture of a once diverse and widespread group of animals.<br><br>The authors describe the evolution of ammonites and their relatives and explain how they created their shells and used them as flotation devices. All the major groups of ammonites are described and illustrated (as are many minor ones), and important material is included on anatomy, feeding, reproduction, and pathology. The 300-million-year existence of ammonites ended at around the same time that dinosaurs became extinct. Fortunately, ammonites were once so abundant that their fossilized shells can be readily found, and the authors provide a helpful guide to locating and collecting these unique fossils.</p><p><b>Neale Monks</b> is a palaeontologist at The Natural History Museum in London, and has written a number of papers on the evolution of beteromorph ammonites. <b>Phil Palmer</b> was a scientist at The Natural History Museum in London until his retirement, and has written extensively on fossil molluses and stratigraphy.</p><h2>Breaking Free from Sin&#39;s Grip: Holiness Defined for a New Generation</h2><p>Holiness describes a way of living made possible through an intimate, personal relationship with God.

Mr. Hollister tells the children that a Christmas gift he had ordered for them has taken overlong in reaching Shoreham and, although he had wanted to keep it a secret, he is now worried about the delay. The gift was a cariole, a French Canadian sleigh, and was to be made by a master sleigh maker in Quebec. He commissions the children to try and solve the mystery of the missing sleigh.

Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children&#x2019;s book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975. Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. He joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate as a writer in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins). The first volume in his own original series, The Happy Hollisters, was published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone. Under various pseudonyms, Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were then worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike. The children loved the stories for their elements of danger and excitement geared to their comprehension level.</p><h2>The Bible, the Church, and Authority: The Canon of the Christian Bible in History and Theology</h2><p><p>Since the early days of Christianity a tension has existed between the authority of the Bible and the authority of the Church. This has been further heightened by the question of Bible translation: How does the Word stand firm and yet continue to speak to a changing Church?</p> <p>Joseph Lienhard, a specialist in Early Christianity, examines the evolution of the Christian canon by casting this question against the life of the early Christians. Among the topics treated are the Christian use of Jewish Scriptures, the Catholic and Protestant Old Testaments, the emergence of the New Testament, the struggle for the right interpretation of the Scriptures, the problem of inspiration, and modern attempts to explain the Church's New Testament canon theologically. The book questions the use of historicist methods of interpretation and appeals to the Rule of Faith as the right norm for interpreting the Scriptures in the Church.</p> <p><i>Joseph T. Lienhard, SJ, earned his doctorate at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany) with two dissertations on Paulinus of Nola and Marcellus of Ancyra. His work is in patristics. He taught at Marquette University from 1975 to 1990, and since 1990 has been at Fordham University, where he is also chair of the department of theology.

The distinguished French critic Charles Delaunay, who knows more about Django than anyone alive, here provides not only the familiar outline of a life--the childhood travels in gypsy caravans, the fire that left Django with a crippled hand, the legendary temper and generosity--but he also collected scores of anecdotes about the sensitivity and musical gifts that were the basis for Django's appearance as a character in Jean Cocteau's <i>Les Enfants Terribles.</i> Who else but Django could charm his way out of a jail sentence by serenading the police officer with his guitar?<br>The comprehensive discography at the back of the book completes Delaunay's picture of this "misrepresented and fantastic creature, at once so captivating and so divorced from the contentions of his age."</p><p><b>Charles Delaunay</b> (1911-1988) was a French author and jazz expert.

Writing in the New Yorker, Peter Schjeldahl called her multi-screen video meditations on the culture of the chador in Islamic Iran "the first undoubtable masterpieces of video installation." Over the next twenty-five years Neshat's work has continued its passionate engagement with ancient and recent Iranian history, extending its reach to the universal experience of living in exile and the human impact of political revolution. This book connects Neshat's early video and photographic works--including haunting films such as <i>Rapture, 1999 </i>and <i>Tooba, 2002</i>--to her current projects which focus on the relation of home to exile and dreams such as <i>The Home of My Eyes, 2015</i>, and a new, never-before-seen project, <i>Land of Dreams, 2019</i>. It includes numerous stills from her series, <i>Dreamers</i>, in which she documents the lives of outsiders and exiles in the United States. This volume also includes essays by prominent Iranian cultural figures as well as an interview with the artist. Neshat has always been a voice for those whose individual freedoms are under attack. With this monograph, her audience will gain a deeper understanding of Neshat's own emotional, psychological, and political identities, and how they have helped her create compassionate portraits of the fraught and delicate spaces between attachment and alienation.<br><br><b>Published with The Broad</b></p><p>ED SCHAD is Curator and Publications Manager at The Broad museum in Los Angeles.</p><h2>The King: Chess Pieces</h2><p>J.H.Donner (1927 - 1988) was a Dutch Grandmaster and one of the greatest writers about chess of all time.

The first people in history to enjoy safe and easy travel, Romans embarked on the original Grand Tour, journeying from the lost city of Troy to the Acropolis, from the Colossus at Rhodes to Egypt, for the obligatory Nile cruise to the very edge of the empire. And, as Tony Perrottet discovers, the popularity of this route has only increased with time.<br><br>Intrigued by the possibility of re-creating the tour, Perrottet, accompanied by his pregnant girlfriend, sets off to discover life as an ancient Roman. The result is this lively blend of fascinating historical anecdotes and hilarious personal encounters, interspersed with irreverent and often eerily prescient quotes from the ancients&#x2014;a vivid portrait of the Roman Empire in all its complexity and wonder.</p><p>&#x201c;Perrottet is a nearly unflappable traveler and a terrifically funny writer; this history-cum-travelogue is as enjoyable as it is informative and twice as quirky.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe<br></i><br>&#x201c;An appealing...mix of the zany and the arcane, juggling an energetic account of ancient Roman travel habits with a witty record of [the author&#x2019;s] own modern journey.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Required reading...a charming popular history of ancient Roman sight-seeing.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Forbes FYI</i><br><br>&#x201c;A splendid trip...a whimsical trek through classical history, famous sites and arcane trivia...provides a rich cache of information about ancient Roman life.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i>Tony Perrottet has written for The New York Times, Esquire, Outside, Civilization, Islands, and The Sunday Times (London), among other publications.

She knows her life is about to change&#x2015;and only for the better. Everything will be blue skies from now on.<br><br>But business school is harder than she thought it would be and the big city not as friendly, until she meets a charming young man from a wealthy family, Loyal Chambers. When Loyal sets his sights on her, Mazy begins to see that everything she&#x2019;d ever wished to have is right before her eyes. The only hindrance to her budding romance is a former beau, Chanis Clay, the young sheriff she thought she&#x2019;d left firmly behind.<br><br>Danger rumbles like thunder on a high mountain ridge when Mazy&#x2019;s cosseted past collides with her clouded future and forces her to come to terms with what she really wants.</p><p>Watson (<i>Troublesome Creek</i>) sets her sweet novel in Lexington, Ky., shortly before WWI. There, Mazy Pelfrey, age 18, is struggling in secretarial school. The young sheriff from her hometown in the Kentucky mountains, Chanis Clay, is sweet on her, but Mazy is dazzled by a wealthy young man, Loyal Chambers, who begins to pay attention to her. Mazy must choose what, and who, she wants&#x2015;a choice that tests her values. The details of Watson&#x2019;s period setting are well researched (Sanitol liquid tooth cleanser, syrup ices). Humor plays a prominent and welcome role in the narrative: an exploding jar of sauerkraut in a root cellar starts the action with a literal bang. Mazy is an engaging character, though some readers may find her youthful innocence cloying. Faith elements are natural and unobtrusive, except for one improbable conversion. Watson offers a well-written, squeaky clean read. (Publishers Weekly)<br><br><i>Buttermilk Sky</i> is a light and refreshing read with beautiful characters who readers will adore. Mazy Pelfrey is a gem whose selfless and na�ve heart is endearing, although her naivet� can also be exasperating. Watson does an excellent job at keeping the story moving while touching on important subjects in a way that is not overbearing or heavy.<br>SUMMARY: After moving from small town life in the mountains of Kentucky, Mazy Pelfrey is not accustomed to life in the city of Lexington. Balancing social life, chores and studies takes up all of her time. However, when a new beau comes along, Mazy is swept off her feet. As she grows used to the new way of life, her past comes calling and Mazy is faced with decisions that will change her life forever. [Four stars.] (Romantic Times)</p><h2>What&#39;s Black About It?

Kydd is a loyal servant of the King, and he is expected to side with Naval authority against his friends, but how can he? Faced with an impossible decision of duty and conscience, he must find a way to save himself and his fellow sailors.</p><p>To my surprise when I started research for this book I found that little had actually been written about the Mutiny at the Nore. Given the nature of the rebellion, and what could have happened had it been successful, this took me somewhat aback. Piecing together the main elements &#x2013; and the key historical figures was a fascinating exercise and I found myself in strong sympathy with Tom Kydd&#x2019;s stand. Later, like many of the mutineers, he was swept along in events beyond his control. Obviously I could not let Tom be hung at the yardarm for his part in the mutiny &#x2013; or the series would have ended there &#x2013; so I had to find a credible way of saving him that would not ruin his chances for further progression in the Navy.Julian Stockwin joined the Royal Navy at 15 and transferred to the Royal Australian Navy when his family emigrated.

In a newly uncertain world, a detective seemed to offer science, conviction, stories that could organise chaos. He turned brutal crimes&#x2014;the vestiges of the beast in man&#x2014;into intellectual puzzles. He was a secular substitute for a prophet or a priest. Yet the Victorians also made a fetish of privacy, and many felt that the investigation at Road Hill amounted to a violation of the middle-class home. Mr Whicher exposed the corruptions within the household: sexual transgression, emotional cruelty, scheming servants, wayward children, insanity, jealousy, loneliness and loathing. The scene he uncovered aroused fear (and excitement) at the thought of what might be hiding behind the closed doors of other respectable houses. His conclusions helped to create an era of voyeurism and suspicion, in which the detective was a shadowy figure, a demon as well as a demigod.</i></p><h2>The Sacrament of Reconciliation (Lex Orandi)</h2><p><p><b>2002 Catholic Press Association Award Winner!</b></p> <p>Although it did not come from Christ in the form it has today, it is clear from Scripture that reconciliation was central to the ministry of Christ.

Theological Studies?The scope and attention to detail evident in David Coffey?s work should ensure that this book becomes indispensable to those concerned with the retrieval of the sacrament of reconciliation in the contemporary church. Coffey?s painstaking rereading of the tradition in regard to reconciliation affirms the importance of this sacrament, sifts what is central from what are accretions, and is crafted with a concern for the effectiveness of the church?s pastoral ministry of reconciliation.

After all these years, the aging country singer still holds a special spot in my uncle&#x2019;s heart. He even sports the matching gray braids and red bandanna to prove it.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting too old for the big pieces,&#x201d; I joke, pulling my foot up onto the counter, where my ass is already parked, to tighten the laces of my boot. I finished my last appointment an hour ago and could have left. Should have left, since the CLOSED sign hanging from a hook on the door is dissuading any potential walk-ins. But every once in a while I like to just sit here and watch my mentor work&#x2014;his hefty frame hunkered down in that same creaky plastic-molded chair. It brings me back to my nine-year-old self, in pigtails and scuffed Mary Janes, trailing my older cousin to the shop so I could draw BIC pen tattoos on burly bikers while they waited for the real thing. It&#x2019;s within these dingy black walls that I discovered my life&#x2019;s passion, all before I turned ten. Not many people can say they&#x2019;ve made that discovery, at any age.<br> <br>&#x201c;Too old, my ass,&#x201d; he grunts. &#x201c;Make yourself useful and grab me my damn dinner.&#x201d;<br> <br>I slide off the counter with a smirk, hitting the button on a cash register that belongs in a museum so I can grab a twenty. &#x201c;Foot-long again?&#x201d; The sub shop two blocks away gets at minimum fifty percent of Ned&#x2019;s weekly food budget.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the jalape�os.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The ones that almost put you in the hospital last time?&#x201d; At fifty-eight, my uncle still eats like he&#x2019;s in his twenties, even though his body is showing signs of revolt, his thickening midsection and aging digestive system begging for more exercise and less fatty and spicy food.<br> <br>&#x201c;I let the girl apprentice here when she was eighteen, and then she abandoned me as soon as she got her license.

That he loves his niece and her smart-ass mouth and her acidic personality, and he&#x2019;s ecstatic that she decided to come back to San Francisco and work alongside him again. He&#x2019;d never take a dime of rent money from me, even if I tried to pay.<br> <br>And I have tried. At two months, when the wanderlust bug hadn&#x2019;t bitten me yet and I realized that I&#x2019;d be staying longer than my usual four months. At four months, when I was afraid I was wearing out my welcome and started talking about finding an apartment to rent, and Ned threatened to kick my ass out of Black Rabbit if I did. At six months, when I left five hundred bucks cash on his dresser and came home to a note and the money pinned to my bedroom door with a steak knife, telling me never to bring up the subject of rent ever again. Except he put it in more colorful language.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been here for seven months now, and for the first time in I don&#x2019;t know how long, I&#x2019;m feeling no itch to leave. Between working alongside Ned six days a week, hanging out with Dakota, an old friend from high school who moved here from Sisters, Oregon, about a year ago, and hitting the streets at night with a crew of guys who are as into decorating walls as I am, I&#x2019;m loving San Francisco. This time around, at least.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d; I turn to leave.<br> <br>Dylan, the guy sitting in the chair with arms as thick as tree trunks, clears his throat rather obnoxiously. This is his fifth session this month. One of those bulky arms is nearly all covered in Ned&#x2019;s elaborate ink.<br> <br>I roll my eyes. He&#x2019;s clocked four hours in that chair tonight, the first half of them spent muttering in an irritatingly croaky voice about how expensive it is to eat organic. I was ready to stuff a cloth into his mouth at around the two-hour mark just to shut him up. I really don&#x2019;t want to give him a reason to speak again. &#x201c;Did you want me to grab you something?&#x201d; I ask, not hiding the reluctance from my voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eight-piece sashimi dinner. Extra wasabi,&#x201d; he says without so much as a &#x201c;please,&#x201d; his eyes glued to the matte-black ceiling above. It doesn&#x2019;t take a genius to figure out that this guy showed up here flying high as a kite. Ned doesn&#x2019;t care if his clients are high or tipsy, as long as they don&#x2019;t stumble in and they circle &#x201c;no&#x201d; to being intoxicated on the client paperwork, he figures it&#x2019;s their ass, should something go wrong. I&#x2019;m guessing this guy has been smoking weed. He&#x2019;s too calm to be strung out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Try again, and make sure it ends with the word &#x2018;sub.&#x2019;?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not going the extra three blocks to the sushi place. I&#x2019;m nobody&#x2019;s fucking errand girl.<br> <br>Tree Trunks dips his head to level me with a flat gaze before focusing on Ned&#x2019;s brow, furrowed in concentration. &#x201c;You gonna let her talk to your customers like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got an issue, you take it up with her. And good luck, because that girl can handle herself like no one I&#x2019;ve ever met,&#x201d; Ned mutters, never one to coddle anybody, even a customer paying well over a grand. He&#x2019;s been running this shop for thirty years &#x201c;the right way,&#x201d; and he&#x2019;s not about to change for &#x201c;a bunch of lily-whites ruining a classic culture.&#x201d; His words, not mine.<br> <br>The guy eyes the full length of me&#x2014;from the shaved sides of my hair and my black tank top and leggings, to my full sleeve of colorful ink, which unsettles some people but shouldn&#x2019;t faze him, seeing as he&#x2019;s getting his own done&#x2014;down to my Doc Martens, and decides against whatever he was going to say, though that pinched expression never leaves his face. &#x201c;Chicken club sub. Grilled. No oil or mayo.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could be a real bitch and demand a &#x201c;please,&#x201d; but I let it go. &#x201c;Back in ten,&#x201d; I call over my shoulder, heading down the narrow hallway to the back door, grabbing my tattoo case on the way, knowing that if I don&#x2019;t toss it in the trunk of my car now, I&#x2019;ll probably forget it later.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch how that new kid over there makes my sandwich. He doesn&#x2019;t know a tomato from his own asshole!&#x201d; Ned&#x2019;s shout catches me just before the door clicks shut.<br> <br>I step out into the crisp evening with my jacket dangling from one arm, and inhale the clean, cool air.<br> <br>And smile.<br> <br>I finally know what home feels like.<br> <br><br> <br>I let myself in through the back of Black Rabbit with my key exactly twenty-two minutes later with two subs: one with double peppers, one with breaded, deep-fried chicken, extra mayo and a splash of oil.<br> <br>Ned was right; I had to give the dumbass behind the counter step-by-step instructions, going so far as to point out the vat of jalape�o peppers directly under his nose. He won&#x2019;t survive a week before Ned revolts. Just the threat of losing Ned&#x2019;s business will probably get the guy canned.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m going to tell my uncle that I think the dumbass is cute, and I&#x2019;m going to date him. I smile, thinking about how Ned might react to that. I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to parade a boyfriend through here for his guaranteed disapproval yet. In the seven months I&#x2019;ve been here, I haven&#x2019;t found one guy in San Francisco that even I approve of. That&#x2019;s been the only downfall of this city, so far, and I&#x2019;m really ready to get out of this dry spell.<br> <br>Tossing my purse onto the old metal desk that serves as a catchall for mail, office supplies, the archaic security-monitoring system, and anything else that might land there on our way through, I reach for the cowbell hanging against the wall. A gag gift that Ned&#x2019;s kept for years, even though the sound of it makes him wince and curse. I use it to irritate the shit out of him every chance I get.<br> <br>A shout freezes my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quit playing fucking games, old man!&#x201d;<br> <br>I hold my breath and try to listen, but the rush of blood flooding my veins and ears suddenly makes it hard to concentrate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know what the hell you&#x2019;re talkin&#x2019; about,&#x201d; Ned grits out, and his voice squeezes my chest, because I can tell that he&#x2019;s in pain. That odd, muted sound of knuckles hitting flesh followed by a groan pulls a gasp from me, and I immediately purse my lips and dart back and out of sight, panicked. Was that loud enough to be heard?<br> <br>Whoever is up front obviously didn&#x2019;t hear me come in. Ned always jokes that I have the natural graces of a cat burglar, silent and stealthy even when I&#x2019;m not intending to be.<br> <br>An aluminum baseball bat leans against the wall next to the cowbell. If I were stupid, I&#x2019;d grab it and run out front kamikaze-style. But Ned is two-hundred and twenty-five pounds of hardened man, Tree Trunks is even bigger, and someone has gotten the upper hand on both of them. I can only imagine how fast they&#x2019;d have a hundred-and-ten-pound female subdued, even one that kicks and claws like a rabid wolverine. I don&#x2019;t even know how many guys are out there.<br> <br>The security camera.<br> <br>I dive for the old thirteen-inch tube monitor sitting on the desk and hit the Power button, desperate to get a glimpse of what&#x2019;s happening out front.<br> <br>But only gray static appears. They must have busted the camera lens.<br> <br>I do the only smart thing I can think of. I fumble for my cell phone, my fingers shaking as I dial 911. Hoping my whispers don&#x2019;t carry as I beg for police backup for a robbery in progress. Can I get to safety? the dispatcher asks. I&#x2019;m not leaving Ned, I snap. Stay on the line, the woman responds. We&#x2019;re sending help.<br> <br>The ding of the cash register sounds, and I hazard a peek around the corner and down the long hall, past the private room, and to the open-concept space at the front where Ned does as much of his work as he can. A hulkish man in dark cargo pants and a black turtleneck, with a black balaclava pulled up over his brow, hovers over the register, emptying it of cash with his left hand.<br> <br>In his right, he grips a gun.<br> <br>I squeeze my phone&#x2014;pressed against my ear&#x2014;tighter.<br> <br>Beyond him, the window and front door are covered, the shades pulled to block anyone&#x2019;s view inside. They weren&#x2019;t like that when I left. I&#x2019;m sure the front door is now locked, too, though it&#x2019;s too far to see from here.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wondered what it feels like to be on the giving end of a tattoo gun,&#x201d; a man with a deep voice and a Chicago accent says, and it&#x2019;s not the same guy I see standing at the register, which means there are at least two of them. Where the hell is Tree Trunks, anyway? Is he in on this? I haven&#x2019;t heard his croaky voice. &#x201c;I just step on this pedal, right?&#x201d; The buzz of the tattoo machine fills the shop, followed closely by a series of grunts.<br> <br>Somehow, I know that it&#x2019;s Ned making those sounds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d; I hiss into my phone, tears streaming down my cheeks, torn between the urge to run out there and pure fear.<br> <br>The guy who was at the cash register is now searching front desk drawers. He glances behind him. &#x201c;You know, you&#x2019;re a sick bastard, Mario.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mario. I have a name.<br> <br>&#x201c;My ex used to say that to me.&#x201d; A sinister chuckle sends shivers down my back. God, what are they doing to Ned? He has ink in a dozen different places. I did a design for him along the web of his finger when I got here seven months ago and he barely flinched then. &#x201c;Go and see what you can find in the back.&#x201d;<br> <br>The back.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m in the back.<br> <br>I duck behind the wall, my heart hammering in my chest as heavy footfalls approach down the hallway toward me. The back door is right there, and yet it&#x2019;s not an option because it&#x2019;s in his line of sight and he has a gun.<br> <br>I have nowhere to run.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; I hiss into the phone, hoping the dispatcher will understand me, will stay quiet so I don&#x2019;t have to hang up on her. I dive under the metal desk, tugging the chair in as far as I can, until my body is contorted around its legs and my entire left side is crammed against the wall. I thank God that I&#x2019;m dressed in all black and hope it&#x2019;s enough, that he won&#x2019;t spot my bare skin. The female dispatcher hides with me under here, my phone pressed against my chest, smothering any sound she might make. She&#x2019;s my only connection to the outside world&#x2014;and perhaps the last person I&#x2019;ll ever speak to&#x2014;and she can surely hear my heartbeat.<br> <br>Polished black combat boots appear around the corner. They stop for five seconds, and I feel each one of those in my throat.<br> <br>And then those shoes swivel and stalk toward me.<br> <br>I can barely focus through my fear anymore, sure that I&#x2019;m about to find myself looking down the barrel of a gun. Where are the police? They should be here by now. We&#x2019;re not far from Daly City, hands down the worst area of San Francisco, where cruisers circle the streets like crows over a ripe cherry tree.<br> <br>Around me, boxes topple and papers shuffle, and I pray to whoever watches down from above that this guy doesn&#x2019;t decide to check beneath the desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Found something!&#x201d; he shouts. It&#x2019;s followed by a snort and a low mutter of, &#x201c;People still use these fucking things?&#x201d;<br> <br>I know what he&#x2019;s found. The VHS player that records the feed from the camera in the front on a continuous loop. Ned&#x2019;s never been one to keep up with technology trends and, instead, swears by what he knows.<br> <br>Sirens wail in the distance. They&#x2019;re so faint at first that I think I&#x2019;m imagining them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fuck! Did you trip an alarm?&#x201d; That angry voice&#x2014;Mario&#x2014;out front yells, and I allow myself a shaky breath of relief because he&#x2019;s heard them, too, so they must be real. Only a few more seconds and we&#x2019;ll be safe.<br> <br>Ned&#x2019;s laugh&#x2014;deep and throaty&#x2014;carries all the way back. Good. Whatever that guy just did to him, Ned&#x2019;s still capable of laughing. Tough bastard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on! We can&#x2019;t get caught here,&#x201d; the guy above me shouts. He starts fussing with the VCR, first pressing, then slamming the Open button. I know that&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;s doing because she&#x2019;s a temperamental bitch and I&#x2019;ve done the exact same thing once or twice when Ned&#x2019;s asked me to change a tape over. &#x201c;Fuck it,&#x201d; he mumbles, and he begins to tug at the cables plugged in beneath the desk. He&#x2019;s taking the entire machine. He wants whatever video proof might be on there, I guess.<br> <br>And if he reaches down to unplug the cord, he&#x2019;s going to find more than just a power strip.<br> <br>I yank the plug out of the socket for him and hold my breath.<br> <br>The sirens grow louder, three distinct wails now. &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; His boots shift away from the desk. Footfalls pound down the hallway, and the guy named Mario appears, also in polished black combat boots. I can see him only from the waist down, but it&#x2019;s enough to see him peeling a black glove off.<br> <br>A splatter of blood coats his wrist.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who the fuck called the cops? I could have gotten him to talk. I just needed more time.&#x201d; I guess he was obviously expecting to work Ned over at a leisurely pace. I ruined that for them, at least.<br> <br>They barrel out the back door.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m still frozen, unsure if it&#x2019;s over or not.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello? Hello?&#x201d; A muted voice calls out, over and over again, and I finally remember the dispatcher pressed against my chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re gone,&#x201d; I whisper into the air, my voice hoarse.<br> <br>And then I snap out of it.<br> <br>I drop the phone and scramble out from under the desk, dashing for the door, my shaking hands snapping the dead bolt shut before those two can decide that it&#x2019;s better to hole up in here.

But our future president wasn&#x2019;t alone. While millions of Americans suffered financial loss, tycoons pounced to heartlessly seize thousands of homes&#x2014;their profiteering made even easier because, as prize-winning investigative reporter Aaron Glantz reveals in Homewreckers, they often used taxpayer money&#x2014;and the Obama administration&#x2019;s promise to cover their losses. </p><p>In <em>Homewreckers</em>, Glantz recounts the transformation of straightforward lending into a morass of slivered and combined mortgage &#x201c;products&#x201d; that could be bought and sold, accompanied by a shift in priorities and a loosening of regulations and laws that made it good business to lend money to those who wouldn&#x2019;t be able to repay. Among the men who laughed their way to the bank: Trump cabinet members Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, Trump pal and confidant Tom Barrack, and billionaire Republican cash cow Steve Schwarzman. <em>Homewreckers</em> also brilliantly weaves together the stories of those most ravaged by the housing crisis. The result is an eye-opening expose of the greed that decimated millions and enriched a gluttonous few. </p></p><p><p>Aaron Glantz is a journalist at Reveal.

Drawing on extensive archival research in North and South Carolina, Laura F. Edwards illuminates those changes by revealing the importance of localized legal practice.<br><br>Edwards shows that following the Revolution, the intensely local legal system favored maintaining the "peace," a concept intended to protect the social order and its patriarchal hierarchies. Ordinary people, rather than legal professionals and political leaders, were central to its workings. Those without rights--even slaves--had influence within the system because of their positions of subordination, not in spite of them. By the 1830s, however, state leaders had secured support for a more centralized system that excluded people who were not specifically granted individual rights, including women, African Americans, and the poor. Edwards concludes that the emphasis on rights affirmed and restructured existing patriarchal inequalities, giving them new life within state law with implications that affected all Americans.<br><br>Placing slaves, free blacks, and white women at the center of the story, <i>The People and Their Peace</i> recasts traditional narratives of legal and political change and sheds light on key issues in U.S. history, including the persistence of inequality--particularly slavery--in the face of expanding democracy.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"This extraordinary book, powerfully conceived and beautifully written, casts a brilliant light on the mysterious processes by which local discretionary justice in the early American republic was gradually overlaid--though never entirely supplanted--by a central, formal state law of rules and rights. From research in thousands of archives, Laura Edwards has brought to life the hierarchical yet communal world of local law in the Carolinas, where rich and poor, husbands and wives, masters and even some slaves brought their claims before courts committed to repair breaches of public order. This book is a pioneering contribution to legal history. It is also a deep and subtle commentary on the rule of law. Subordinate peoples may sometimes fare better in informal regimes that allow their participation than in formal legal systems of individual rights, from which, if they have no rights, they may be shut out entirely."--Robert W.

Wildly romantic and full of bizarre enthusiasms, these activists were pioneers of a new political consciousness. And their legacy has much to teach us about today&#x2019;s human rights crises.</p><p><b>Gary J. Bass</b> is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of <i>Stay the Hand of Vengeance: The Politics of War Crimes Tribunals</i>. A former reporter for <i>The Economist,</i> he has written often for the<i> New York Times,</i> and has also written for <i>The New Yorker,</i> <i>The Washington Post,</i> the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> <i>The New Republic,</i> and <i>Foreign Affairs</i>.Introduction<br><br>The president of the United States, in his State of the Union speech, gave a grave warning to the American people. He noted that overseas "there are occasional crimes committed on so vast a scale and of such peculiar horror" that the United States had a duty to step in. "In extreme cases action may be justifiable and proper." In a few cases, depending on "the degree of the atrocity and upon our power to remedy it," the president argued, "we could interfere by force of arms . . . to put a stop to intolerable conditions." This was an explicit call for using U.S. troops to save foreigners. It was not from Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter&#x2014;the two presidents who claimed to make human rights a centerpiece of their foreign policy. The president was Theodore Roosevelt; the year was 1904; his example was Cuba, where Roosevelt had famously put his own neck on the line against Spanish atrocities. 1<br><br>This was familiar rhetoric. Roosevelt's audience would not have been scandalized or confused by his words on this formal occasion. The president of the United States gave a ringing message about what we today would call humanitarian intervention, in ways that would be stunning almost a century later, and nobody thought too much of it. Something has been lost since then. The tradition of humanitarian intervention once ran deep in world politics, long before Rwanda and Kosovo came to the world's fitful attention. Over a century ago, it was a known principle that troops should sometimes be sent to prevent the slaughter of innocent foreigners. That principle has recently reemerged with fresh strength in the aftermath of the Cold War, but it is anything but new.<br><br>Human rights policies are usually thought of today as being largely an innovation of the Carter presidency, making another appearance in the Clinton administration&#x2014;or, at most, going back to Woodrow Wilson. Before that, on this account, international politics were run by hard-nosed diplomats, unsentimental about foreign lives and liberties but dedicated to maintaining the balance of power. The fate of the world was worked out at lordly conferences in Vienna, Paris, and Berlin, behind closed doors thick enough to shut out the hubbub of mass opinion. This common belief that humanitarianism has no real historical standing has been used powerfully to oppose U.S. and European missions abroad.<br><br>But in fact, the century<i> before</i> Wilson's presidency was anything but an age of unbroken realpolitik. Especially in Victorian Britain, this was a period rich in what we today would recognize clearly as human rights rhetoric, all the way up to the highest levels. This was the time of the antislavery campaign in Britain, and then of the mass uproar against vicious Belgian colonial rule in the Congo. It was the era of philhellenism in Britain and pan-Slavism in Russia, of liberal sympathy for the national minorities crushed by the Ottoman and Austrian and Russian empires, of intrusive and sovereignty-defying treaties to safeguard minority rights, of French solicitude for Syria's Christians, and of wild popular convulsions in British politics on behalf of the Bulgarians. The most magical names&#x2014;from Byron to Dostoevsky&#x2014;entered the lists on behalf of foreign suffering. 2<br><br>These emotional pleas were a regular feature of international politics throughout much of the nineteenth century, resulting in several important military missions. The basic ideas go all the way back to Thucydides, who, horrified at bloody ancient civil wars, hoped for the endurance of "the general laws of humanity which are there to give a hope of salvation to all who are in distress." As early as 1625, in his classic <i>De Jure Belli et Pacis</i>, Hugo Grotius argued, <br><br>If the Injustice be visible, as if a <i>Busiris</i>, a <i>Phalaris</i>, or a <i>Thracian Diomedes</i> exercise such Tyrannies over Subjects, as no good Man living can approve of, the Right of human Society shall not be therefore excluded. Thus <i>Constantine</i> made War against <i>Maxentius</i> and <i>Licinius</i>; and other Roman Emperors against the <i>Persians</i>, or threatned them with it at least, unless they left off persecuting Christians on the account of their Religion only.<br><br>Humanitarian intervention was once a relatively familiar European practice, and was understood as such&#x2014;not just by the intervening countries, but even sometimes by the government whose sovereignty was being violated in the name of humanity. 3<br><br>All of the major themes of today's heated debates about humanitarian intervention&#x2014;about undermining sovereignty or supporting universal human rights, about altruistic or veiled imperialistic motivations, about the terrible dangers of taking sides in civil wars and ethnic conflicts, about the role of public opinion and the press in shaping democratic foreign policy, about multilateral and unilateral uses of force, about the moral responsibility of political leaders&#x2014;were voiced loud and clear throughout the nineteenth century. In their elegant cursive, in dispatches ornamentally sealed with red wax and delivered in safe boxes, the diplomats of a century and three-quarters ago were negotiating many of the same questions that Bill Clinton faced in Bosnia and Rwanda and that George W. Bush faced in Congo and Darfur. They knew things then that we have forgotten now.<br><br>Human Rights in History<br><br>Why do we let evil happen? Why do we sometimes rally to stop it? And, when we do act, how can we act more effectively? These are the core questions of this book. Good-hearted people all too often stand by in the face of enormous bloodshed overseas. As the British scholar Arnold Toynbee fumed, Mussolini could only get away with conquering Abyssinia because of "a negative, weak-willed, cowardly egotism" in Britain and France. The experience of past centuries must show a way to do at least a little better. 4<br><br>So this book has three overarching themes. First, humanitarian interventions are not just a newfangled experiment from the 1990s. Humanitarian intervention has a deep history, which is worth understanding both for its own sake and for the light it casts on current debates. Today's human rights advocates are neither faddish nor even particularly modern; they are the ideological and organizational descendants of the nineteenth century's activists against cruelty in remote places like Greece and Bulgaria. <br><br>This activism was not just a matter of imperialism. Unlike the recent advocates of a new kind of American human rights imperialism, I want to keep a bright line between empire and humanity. This book is, in part, a history of activists who campaigned against massacre abroad, while also frowning on the imperialism of their own country. There was a genuine humanitarianism at work in the making of some foreign policy in the nineteenth century, which was not the same thing as that era's imperialism. Of course, I do not mean to suggest that the whole of the nineteenth century was humanitarian&#x2014;only that there were some important episodes even in a horribly imperialistic age, including several of the biggest foreign policy crises of the day. Rediscovering this long history levels the playing field in present-day debates between human rights advocates and more conservative realists, rather than leaving realists dominant as the exponents of traditional statecraft. Even in the heyday of imperialism and realpolitik, the politics of human rights made a big impact on foreign policy.<br><br>Nor was this only a matter of pan-Christian solidarity: of European Christians rescuing fellow Christians overseas. Christianity was certainly part of the story, but not the whole of it. Some of the most important activists hoped to save humanity, not just Christianity. Although much of the diplomatic attention focused on the Ottoman Empire, liberal Europeans also intervened in Naples, and argued for confronting Russia and Austria. Looking at the activists and listening in on the domestic debates about intervention, it was often the most Christian-identified actors who opposed intervention, while the more secular liberals supported it. Most strikingly, the Church of England opposed humanitarian intervention to rescue Greeks, Bosnians, and Bulgarians. Christian identity was a motive for some of the activists, but most Britons supporting the Greeks were drawn more by their pagan past than their Orthodox present. The British voiced substantial sympathy not just for suffering Christians, but also for Ottomans, Druzes, and enslaved Africans. The agitation over the Bulgarians in the 1870s paved the way to the modern human rights movement, with William Ewart Gladstone resoundingly speaking out on behalf of the human rights of Zulus and Afghans. 5<br><br>Second, this book looks at the way freedom at home can help promote freedom abroad. As domestic liberalism grew up in Britain, the United States, and, to some extent, France, the governments there found their foreign policy being pushed by their own homegrown freedoms: above all the power of a newly unshackled free press that could report on foreign atrocities; and then a free society that could react with horror at those atrocities, and politicians inside and outside the government jockeying for political power by trying to capture that public passion. The governments had to sit up and take notice when their so-called atrocitarians demanded heroic rescues of suffering populations, even when the mission would be in some obscure part of the world that served no strategic purpose&#x2014;or undermined the government's realpolitik policy.<br><br>The new mass media played a particularly crucial role in pressuring a free government toward humanitarian intervention. These governments could not silence their own press, nor prevent them from reporting embarrassing news from inconvenient places. Skyrocketing newspaper circulations, better kinds of technology like the telegraph, increasing journalistic professionalism: all of this sometimes made it impossible for politicians to get away with quietly pursuing a foreign policy based on realpolitik. Once the press broke a gruesome story, the officials of a liberal state could find themselves under crushing pressure to respond. The exact placement of the reporters made a big difference. In short: humanitarian intervention is not new, and neither is the so-called CNN effect.<br><br>Before the rise of an effective and credible free press, the dark news of an atrocity overseas would reach the halls of power through ambassadors, consuls, or spies; if the government wanted, the information could be largely hidden from the public. But when the news came from the press, or from activist groups, then it went straight to the public. No matter how awkward it might be for their diplomacy, politicians in a free state could do little to stop their own newspapers from reporting hideous news&#x2014;or to stop newspaper readers from reacting with shock and horror at what they read.<br><br>Sometimes senior government officials will genuinely care about suffering foreigners, as Madeleine Albright did for Bosnians and Kosovars, and George H. W. Bush reportedly did for Somalis. But successful politicians are often pretty cold fishes, and are more likely to take the risk of war if they are under pressure at home. So well-organized pressure groups, like today's human rights groups or the London Greek Committee in the 1820s, can have a powerful impact on a government's thinking. 6<br><br>Life was a little easier for despots. In unfree countries, like tsarist Russia, the government can censor the press, or control it so that it only reports stories that are convenient to the government's foreign policy. The state can feed its public the requisite propaganda to encourage only those foreign solidarities that help advance the state's imperialist or expansionist goals. And if the public gets too agitated, the state can try to use its repressive machinery to kill, jail, or cow the activists. None of those options is available to a political leader in a free country.<br><br>In other words, humanitarian intervention emerged as a fundamentally liberal enterprise, wrapped up with the progress of liberal ideals and institutions. Ideologically, it grew out of the radical ideas of freedom and the rights of man, a driving force in world politics since the French Revolution in 1789; institutionally, it grew up along with the rise of the mass media, public opinion, and responsive government. Even a little bit of liberalism, as seen in the nineteenth century's major constitutional states like Britain, can lead to surprisingly big effects in foreign policy. 7<br><br>Finally, there is something to be learned from the way that diplomats in the nineteenth century managed the practice of humanitarian intervention. After all, even limited humanitarian interventions&#x2014;like any use of military force&#x2014;carry enormous risks. They can be foils for imperialist conquest and occupation, draw big states into rivalry, or spark devastating wider wars between great powers.<br><br>Even if a president or prime minister has credible information about atrocities, and there is strong public sympathy for those victims, there must still be a cold realpolitik calculation about the costs of intervening. If the foreign murderers are relatively weak, it may be tempting to confront them. But if a humanitarian intervention would lead to a broader international crisis, or plunge the country&#x2014;or the world&#x2014;into a massive war, then most cabinets will decide that it is just not worth it. After all, governments are opportunistic in their humanitarianism, as they are with any military venture; believing in human rights does not make one suicidal.<br><br>Still, the diplomats of the nineteenth century developed some important ways to reduce the international dangers from a humanitarian intervention. They engaged in complex exercises in self-restraint to prove that their intentions were limited only to unselfish humanitarianism, rather than conquest or imperialism. These governments voluntarily limited the size and duration of their military missions; relied on specific treaties to delineate what could be called spheres of humanitarian interest; and engaged in successful multilateral practices of consultation that are as striking as anything ever dreamed of at the League of Nations or the United Nations.<br><br>The rest of this part of this book will be spent establishing and fleshing out these main arguments. First, there will be a challenge to the influential notion that "humanitarian" interventions are really just veiled imperialism. This will be followed by taking on the related argument that the nineteenth century's "humanitarian" interventions were actually pan-Christian missions, arguing instead that a broader humanitarianism was actually at work. Next comes a turn to domestic politics, looking at how the mass media shapes this sense of the fellow humanity of foreigners, and how domestic politics plays out in free and authoritarian states. Finally, there will be a look at the diplomacy of humanitarian intervention.<br>1. A Compilation of the Messages and Speeches of Theodore Roosevelt, 1901&#x2014;1905, ed.

Drawing on aspects of Akan thought that appear to diverge from Western conceptions in the areas of ethics and metaphysics, Wiredu calls for a just reappraisal of these disparities, free of thought patterns corrupted by a colonial mentality.

An empassioned defence of Sebond&#39;s fifteenth-century treatise on natural theology, it was inspired by the deep crisis of personal melancholy that followed the death of Montaigne&#39;s own father in 1568, and explores contemporary Christianity in prose that is witty and frequently damning. As he searches for the true meaning of faith, Montaigne is heavily critical of the arrogant tendency of mankind to create God in its own image, and offers his personal reflections on the true role of man, the need to eschew personal arrogance, and the vital importance of faith if we are to understand our place in the universe. Wise, perceptive and remarkably informed, this is one of the true masterpieces of the essay form.</p><p>Michel Eyquem, Seigneur de Montaigne, was born in 1533, the son and heir of Pierre, Seigneur de Montaigne (two previous children dying soon after birth). He was brought up to speak Latin as his mother tongue and always retained a Latin turn of mind; though he knew Greek, he preferred to use translations. After studying law he eventually became counselor to the Parlement of Bordeaux. He married in 1565. In 1569 he published his French version of the <b>Natural Theology</b> of Raymond Sebond; his <b>Apology</b> is only partly a defense of Sebond and sets skeptical limits to human reasoning about God, man and nature. He retired in 1571 to his lands at Montaigne, devoting himself to reading and reflection and to composing his <b>Essays</b> (first version, 1580). He loathed the fanaticism and cruelties of the religious wars of the period, but sided with Catholic orthodoxy and legitimate monarchy. He was twice elected Mayor of Bordeaux (1581 and 1583), a post he held for four years. He died at Montaigne (1592) while preparing the final, and richest, edition of his <b>Essays</b>.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Red Virgin and the Vision of Utopia</h2><p>The creative partnership of acclaimed writer and academic Mary M.

But how did trolls go from folktales to the World Wide Web?<br> &nbsp;<br> To explain why trolls still hold our interest, John Lindow goes back to their first appearances in Scandinavian folklore, where they were beings in nature living beside a preindustrial society of small-scale farming and fishing. He explores reports of actual encounters with trolls&#x2015;meetings others found plausible in spite of their better judgment&#x2015;and follows trolls&#x2019; natural transition from folktales to other domains in popular culture. Trolls, Lindow argues, would not continue to appeal to our imaginations today if they had not made the jump to illustrations in Nordic books and Scandinavian literature and drama. From the Moomins to Brothers Grimm and Three Billy Goats Gruff to cartoons, fantasy novels, and social media, Lindow considers the panoply of trolls that surround us and their sometimes troubling connotations in the contemporary world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taking readers into Norwegian music and film and even Yahoo Finance chat rooms,&nbsp;<i>Trolls</i>&nbsp;is a fun and fascinating book about these strange creatures.</p><p><b>John Lindow</b> is professor of Scandinavian at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of <i>Norse Mythology: A Guide to Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs</i> and <i>Medieval Folklore: A Guide to Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs</i>.&#x201c;With the erudition and wit we have come to expect of his scholarship, Professor Lindow takes the reader on a journey into the complex processes that inform literature and lore&#x2015;and modern commercial culture.

Since our original publication over ten years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of cell phone and internet technology. The birth of the term &#x2018;helicopter parent' is, in part, due to the instant and frequent connectivity that parents have with their children today. Parents are struggling with the appropriate use of communicative technology and aren't aware of its impact on their child's development, both personally and academically. </p><p>With straightforward practicality and using humorous and helpful case examples and dialogues, <i>Don't Tell Me What To Do, Just Send Money </i>helps parents lay the groundwork for a new kind of relationship so that they can help their child more effectively handle everything they'll encounter during their college years.</p></p><p>Parenting a college-bound student is a tricky business--combining your emotional and financial support with your child's newfound independence can seem nearly impossible. The authors of <i>Don't Tell Me What to Do, Just Send Money</i> are all too familiar with these difficulties and have created a practical guide that addresses specific situations and provides effective guidelines for changing the parent-child relationship. Topics are addressed frankly, and many parents may have trouble reading the sections concerning controversial subjects such as drug and alcohol use, birth control, homosexuality, and changes in religious and political beliefs. The emphasis here is not on changing your kid's mind about any of these things, but rather how parents can approach these sensitive topics while maintaining a positive and honest relationship. Most pages contain small text boxes highlighting what's on your mind and what's on your child's mind, as well as practical lists suggesting what to do and what to avoid, and these can be extremely helpful as a quick reference when faced with a sudden announcement from your student who's decided to change majors, stop living in the dorm, or study abroad.<p> With a down-to-earth tone and clear insight into the minds of both parents and college students, this is an easy-to-read book that manages to handle difficult topics without preaching or downplaying important events. Ultimately, this book aims to help parents and their nearly adult children make the transition to a new kind of relationship, ideally one that is open and mutually respectful. With careful reading and consideration, the suggestions presented will help create a handy road map to lead you through the twists and turns of parenting your college student. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>HELEN JOHNSON founded and directed Cornell University's first Parents' Program and is now engaged in her own consulting business with college parents and universities. </p><p>CHRISTINE SCHELAS-MILLER teaches a course on adolescence and emerging adulthood in the department of human development at Cornell University and coordinates student advising as the assistant director of undergraduate studies.

This depopulation is not being perpetrated by the federal government, but by Native governments that are banishing, denying, or disenrolling Native citizens at an unprecedented rate. Since the 1990s, tribal belonging has become more of a privilege than a sacred right. Political and legal dismemberment has become a national phenomenon with nearly eighty Native nations, in at least twenty states, terminating the rights of indigenous citizens.<br><br>The first comprehensive examination of the origins and significance of tribal disenrollment, <i>Dismembered</i> examines this disturbing trend, which often leaves the disenrolled tribal members with no recourse or appeal. At the center of the issue is how Native nations are defined today and who has the fundamental rights to belong. By looking at hundreds of tribal constitutions and talking with both disenrolled members and tribal officials, the authors demonstrate the damage this practice is having across Indian Country and ways to address the problem.</p><p><p>A strange thing is happening in Indian Country: the number of federally-recognized Native nations continues to increase, while the population figures for existing tribal nations continues to decline. This depopulation of an ever increasing number of native citizens is being perpetrated not by the federal government but by Native governments which are banishing, denying, or disenrolling otherwise bonafide native citizens at an unprecedented level. Political and legal dismemberment has become a national phenomenon with nearly eighty Native nations in at least twenty states engaging in the practices of terminating the rights of indigenous citizens, in numerous cases without equal protection at law or due process of law and with no effective remedy for the deprivation of their essential rights.This study is the first comprehensive treatment of the origins, significance, and contemporary situation involving native citizen dismemberment by tribal government action.Native nations have always possessed the inherent authority to denationalize any tribal member or to physically expel members and even non-member natives and non-natives as well. But this study argues that far too many Indigenous nations are engaging in dismemberment practices that clearly violate their own historic values and principles which at one time utilized peacemaking, mediation, restitution, and compensation to resolve the inevitable disputes that occasionally arose.The subject of tribal dismemberment raises the vital question of how Native nations are defined today, and prompts the related questions of who has the fundamental right to belong in these nations and what are the grounds upon which an individual's relationship to their nation may be politically, legally, or culturally severed by native governing elites. These questions are the heart of this book.Tribal belonging, long viewed as an absolute given by Native citizens, since the early 1990s has become more of a political privilege than a sacred and organic kinship right as defined by tribal officialdom. Such dismemberments are happening for a variety of reasons that will be explored in the book, but the two most apparent factors associated with the practices are increased gambling revenue and criminal activity that presumably threatens community stability.After examining the early history and evolution of banishment and disenrollment, the study moves to provide a thorough empirical analysis of both Native and federal court cases that have dealt with disenrollment matters and concludes by discussing numerous ideas and proposed mechanisms to address Native expulsions.</p><b>David E.

Thus divided, both the northern and southern colonies could have been defeated in detail, unable to provide mutual assistance against further attacks.<br><br>Yet, despite intense planning and vast efforts, Britain's campaign resulted in disaster when General John Burgoyne, with 6,000 soldiers, emerged from a woodline and surrendered his army to the Patriots at Saratoga in October 1777.<br><br>Underneath the umbrella of Saratoga, countless battles and skirmishes were waged from the borders of Canada southward to Ticonderoga, Bennington, and West Point. Heroes on both sides were created by the score, though only one side proved victorious, amid a tapestry of madness, cruelty, and hardship in what can rightfully be called "the terrible Wilderness War of 1777."<br><br>MICHAEL O.

But the eager, expectant visitor is not regaled with the sight of charismatic vertebrates, gaudy birds, and luminous orchids. In the rainforest, close encounters with life that moves are usually rare but brilliant episodes; one is bedazzled for an instant and then left alone in the quiet greenery. Under such conditions, one must see the episode as part of a process; tracing the connections between organisms is the essence of rainforest appreciation."&#x2015;Nature of the Rainforest</p><p>Nature of the Rainforest is a breathtaking tour of an environment that is the pinnacle of biodiversity and evolutionary sophistication by an award-winning author and two photographers who love the rainforest, understand its intricacies, and have spent considerable time there documenting its wildlife and complexity. Adrian Forsyth draws on four decades of personal encounters with the animals of the rainforest&#x2015;including poison-dart frogs, three-toed sloths, bushmasters, and umbrellabirds&#x2015;as a starting point to communicate key ecological topics such as biodiversity, coevolution, rarity, chemical defense, nutrient cycling, and camouflage. </p><p>The luminous photographs capture stunning and rare creatures in action, including the now- extinct golden toad mating, a jaguar on the prowl, and the hermit hummingbird feeding. The behaviors and characteristics of the rainforest inhabitants featured here not only illustrate the text but also advance the scientific narrative and exemplify the critical importance of conservation. Thematic chapters are interspersed with four chapters devoted to specific habitats and regions of Costa Rica and Peru, areas with some of the most diverse arrays of plant and animal species in the world. The result is an exuberant celebration of the rainforest in text and images.</p></p><p>"Adrian Forsyth contributes with this book to the genuine literature of ecology, wherein exact knowledge is expressed through the prisms of disciplined emotion. Such writing requires a rare combination of scientific training and metaphorical skill, and Forsyth displays the instincts of a creative writer, taking us deep into the tropical rainforest.

Wilson <p> "Nature of the Rainforest is an absolutely spectacular, essential addition to the library of any natural history buff, ecologist, or tropical forest conservationist. Its text reads like a Sand County Almanac for the tropics (something long needed and overdue) while the stunning photographs depict stories of how life works in this unique ecosystem.

The shapeshifting city of Havana is a riveting character in itself, and contributes greatly to the atmosphere.<i> The Third Hotel</i> explores the oddities of travel and relationships; silence and noise; and the effects of past trauma. Like Clare, it is an engrossing, thought-provoking enigma." <b>&#x2015;Julia Kastner, <i>Shelf Awareness</i></b></p><p>"A reality-blurring rumination on the power of grief and alienation . . . Lush in description and psychology alike, <i>The Third Hotel</i> is a literary horror novel that will haunt you long past its final page." <b> &#x2015;Emily Nordling, tor.com</b></p><p>"Laura van den Berg&#x2019;s new novel, <i>The Third Hotel</i>, covers a thematically sprawling range of subjects, from zombie films to the secret flaws of a marriage to the process of grieving someone who may not be as dead as initially expected. The result is a haunting, ambiguous novel, cerebral and tactile in equal measure." <b>&#x2015;<i>Vol. 1 Brooklyn</i></b><br><b></b><br>"Laced through with sharp insights&#x2015;not just on marriage and grief, but also on the pull of travel and the dynamics of horror movies&#x2015;the layers of [<i>The Third Hotel</i>] fit together so seamlessly they're almost Escher-esque. The line between the real and the imagined is forever blurry, and the result of all that ambiguity is both moving and unsettling. Gorgeously haunting and wholly original; a novel that rewards patience." &#x2015;<i><b>Kirkus</b></i></p><p>"Mysterious and engrossing . . . Toying with horror tropes and conventions, and displaying shades of authors such as Julio Cort�zar, van den Berg turns Clare&#x2019;s journey into a dreamlike exploration of grief. This is a potent novel about life, death, and the afterlife." <b>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Third Hotel</i> luxuriates in the fertile narrative ground of the uncanny, the phantasmagoric and the depths of grief. Van den Berg explores the contours of the most intimate human relationships: between married couples and between parents and children. This is heavy stuff, but Van den Berg also delights in her fluency with film culture and Latin American modes of expression." <b>&#x2015;Ryne Clos, <i>Spectrum Culture</i></b></p><p>"Brooding, often-surreal, funerally bemusing . . . van den Berg's entrancing, gorgeously enigmatic tale dramatizes the narcosis of grief." <b>&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;I love Laura van den Berg for her eeriness and her elegance, the way the fabric of her stories is woven on a slightly warped loom so that you read her work always a bit perturbed. <i>The Third Hotel</i> is artfully fractured, slim and singular; it&#x2019;s a book that sings, but always with a strange pressure more felt than heard beneath the song.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Lauren Groff, author of <i>Fates and Furies</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;In this gorgeous, frighteningly smart novel, a woman deranged by grief becomes an imposter in her own life. As inventive and inexorable as a dream, <i>The Third Hotel</i> is a devastating excavation of the unconscionable demands we place on those we love, and a profound portrait of the uncanny composite creature that is a marriage. Laura van den Berg is one of our best writers, an absolute marvel.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Garth Greenwell, author of <i>What Belongs to You</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;I <i>love</i> the way Laura van den Berg writes. <i>The Third Hotel</i> is another of her beguiling little masterpieces. One that, with ruminative grace and sublime wit, answers and elucidates the question of what it means to be human.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Miriam Toews, author of <i>All My Puny Sorrows</i></b><br><b></b><br>&#x201c;I've always been a huge fan of Laura van den Berg's work, but this novel took my breath away. <i>The Third Hotel</i> is a ghost story for grownups&#x2015;when the search for clarity becomes obscure and reality is increasingly blurred. There is so much confidence and daring in her writing, but at the same time her slanted view of the world holds a kind of humility and clarity that makes it all feel so achingly human. Elegant, twisted, and propulsive, I loved it." <b>&#x2015;Claire Cameron, author of <i>The Last Neanderthal</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;After finishing <i>The Third Hotel</i> I found myself reeling for days. What a triumph of a book! Such a gorgeous, intelligent excavation of marriage, loss, art, fl�nerie. Simply spending time inside Laura van den Berg's elegant, muscular sentences has made me a better writer.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Kristen Iskandrian, author of <i>Motherest</i></b></p><p>"Dazzling . . . Van Den Berg gives loveliness to the gruesome while opening up the novel&#x2019;s world to all kinds of ghosts. The real emotional power of the novel, however, beyond the elegance of its language and the precision and momentum of its telling, builds from what ends up being a brutal moment of confrontation.

While many books have been written on this allegedly most decisive battle of the Second World War, many legends live on, above all because of misleading information that recur in most publications &#x2013; even in the most recent ones. Based on almost 20 years of research reassessing the primary sources, Roman Toeppel sheds light on the phase of decision-making, the preparations and the development of the battle in an engaging style that grips the reader&#x2019;s attention from the first page on. The author concentrates on little-known developments and events leading the reader to astonishing results. He also gives entirely new insights into the historiographic appraisal of this battle, putting thoroughly researched facts against erroneous popular beliefs, myths and legends that have been passed down among historians for generations.</p><p>Roman Toeppel was born in Bautzen, Germany, in 1976. From 1996 to 2001 he studied history and political science at the University of Dresden. He completed his master&#x2019;s degree with a thesis about the Battle of Kursk. Subsequently, Toeppel received his doctor&#x2019;s degree for his research on Saxony in the Age of Napoleon that resulted in the publication of his book &#x201c;The Saxons and Napoleon.&#x201d; Based on his substantial contribution to the study of the Napoleonic Wars and the Second World War, he was selected to work on the critical edition of Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s &#x201c;Mein Kampf&#x201d; at the renowned Institute of Contemporary History in Munich. Toeppel is one of the four editors of this award-winning critical edition. Since 2015 Toeppel has been working as a freelance historian in Munich.

With British, French and German forces locked in a stalemate in the trenches of the Western Front, an attack was launched by the massed Russian armies to the east. The assault was intended to knock Austria-Hungary out of the war and divert German troops from the Western Front, easing the pressure on Russia's allies. Russia's dismal military performance in the preceding years was forgotten, as the Brusilov Offensive was quickly characterized by innovative tactics. Most impressive of all was the Russian use of shock troops, a strategy that German armies would later use to great effect in the final years of the war.</p><p>Drawing on first-hand accounts and detailed archival research Buttar gives a dramatic retelling of final years of the war on the Eastern Front, with the Russian Army claiming military success at a cost so high that it was never able to recover.</p></p><p><b>Prit Buttar</b> studied medicine before joining the British Army as a doctor.

Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who had neither an M.D. nor a PhD, got his start in the cartoon business illustrating ads for an insecticide company, but he soon turned his talent to political purposes. Although he never seems to have joined a left organization, Seuss was a man of the Popular Front, that broad left vessel anchored by the Communist Party. For two years in the early 1940s, he was a regular cartoonist for the left-wing New York City daily PM, contributing hundreds of drawings that skewered such figures as Charles Lindbergh for warming up to Hitler and flagrant racists like Governor Eugene Talmadge of Georgia.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the war, Seuss began to produce children&#x2019;s books that used witty rhymes and fluid, fanciful drawings to convey the best principles and some of the fondest aspirations of the left. He kept this up until his death in 1989. The books, which have sold millions of copies, include <i>The Sneetches</i>, a brief for racial equality; <i>Yertle the Turtle</i>, a satire of fascist tyranny; <i>The Lorax</i>, a plea to save nature from corporate greed<i>; The Butter Battle Book</i>, a fable in support of nuclear disarmament; and <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>, a parable about the need to act against genocide. His most famous book, <i>The Cat in the Hat,</i> while less overtly political, introduced a sublimely destructive feline who did his bit to inspire the counterculture of the 1960s.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seuss made great children&#x2019;s literature out of the essential critique and vision of the left. He married the ideal of social equality to the principle of personal freedom. As the journalist E. J. Kahn Jr. put it: &#x201c;In his books, might never makes right, the meek inherit the earth, and pride frequently goeth before a fall, usually a pratfall.&#x201d; Seuss crafted &#x201c;messages&#x201d; with more wit, hipness, and color than any movement activist I have ever known. But he rarely took part in protests or campaigns, and few of his readers appreciated that he was illustrating a coherent and quite political worldview.3<br> &nbsp;<br> Seuss&#x2019;s work was an underappreciated accomplishment in the long, if often difficult, history of the American left. Radicals in the U.S. have seldom mounted a serious challenge to those who held power in either the government or the economy. But they have done far better at helping to transform the moral culture, the &#x201c;common sense&#x201d; of society&#x2014;how Americans understand what is just and what is unjust in the conduct of public affairs. And that is no small thing. &#x201c;The most enduring aspects of a social movement,&#x201d; writes the historian J. F. C. Harrison, &#x201c;are not always its institutions but the mental attitudes which inspire it and which are in turn generated by it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leftists who articulated big dreams of a different future did much to initiate what became common, if still controversial, features of American life. These included the advocacy of equal opportunity and equal treatment for women, ethnic and racial minorities, and homosexuals; the celebration of sexual pleasure unconnected to reproduction; a media and educational system sensitive to racial and gender oppression and which celebrates what we now call multiculturalism; and the popularity of novels and films with a strongly altruistic and anti-authoritarian point of view.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of these cultural radicals were famous, or infamous, in their own time and remain staples of classroom lectures today: the abolitionists Harriet Beecher Stowe and Frederick Douglass, the class-conscious utopians Edward Bellamy and Henry George, the sexual radicals Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman, the pro-Communist entertainers Paul Robeson and Woody Guthrie, the feminist writer Betty Friedan, and the black power orator Stokely Carmichael. Others, like Max Eastman, editor of The Masses, are familiar mainly to academics who understand how critical that magazine was to the rise of a modernist sensibility in the early twentieth century.<br> &nbsp;<br> A focus on what the left did to alter American culture can provide a partial answer to the most important question one can raise about any movement in history: What difference did it make to the nation and the world?<br> &nbsp;<br> The ability of radicals to develop a culture of rebellion, of alienation from domestic authorities, and to expand the meaning of equality appealed to many Americans who gave little or no thought to actually voting for a left candidate or joining a radical party. The cultural left articulated outrage about the state of the world and the longing for a different one in ways the political left was unable to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> A caveat is necessary here. Culture and politics are not separate spheres; a cultural change can have important political consequences. For example, the feminist awakening of the 1960s and &#x2019;70s began a process that led to more liberal state abortion laws and then to Roe v. Wade&#x2014;as well as to funding for child-care centers, laws against sexual harassment, and an increase in women running for and getting elected to public office. Conversely, a profound shift in the political sphere can alter private opinions and behavior. The Civil War did away with human bondage, which made it possible, albeit in painfully slow steps, to establish a new common sense about the moral imperative to treat individuals equally, regardless of their race.<br> &nbsp;<br> But when political radicals made a big difference, they generally did so as decidedly junior partners in a coalition driven by establishment reformers. Abolitionists did not achieve their goal until midway through the war, when Abraham Lincoln and his fellow Republicans realized that the promise of emancipation could speed victory for the North. Militant unionists were not able to gain a measure of power in mines and factories and on the waterfront until Franklin Roosevelt needed labor votes during the New Deal. Only when Lyndon Johnson and other liberal Democrats conquered their fears of disorder and gave up on the white South could the black freedom movement celebrate passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts. For a political movement to gain any major goal, it needs to win over a section of the governing elite (it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to gain support from some wealthy philanthropists as well). Only on a handful of occasions has the left achieved such a victory, and it never occurred under its own name.<br> &nbsp;<br> The divergence between political marginality and cultural influence stems, in part, from the kinds of people who have been the mainstays of the American left. During just one period of about four decades&#x2014;from the late 1870s to the end of World War I&#x2014;could radicals authentically claim to represent more than a tiny number of Americans who belonged to what was, and remains, the majority of the population: white Christians from the working and lower-middle classes. At the time, this group included Americans from various trades and regions who condemned the growth of corporations for controlling the marketplace, corrupting politicians, and degrading civic morality.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this period ended after World War I&#x2014;due partly to a epochal split in the international socialist movement. Radicals lost most of the constituency they had gained among ordinary white Christians and have never been able to regain it. Thus, the wage-earning masses who voted for Socialist, Communist, and Labor parties elsewhere in the industrial world were almost entirely lost to the American left&#x2014;and deeply skeptical about the vision of solidarity that inspired the great welfare states of Europe.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the rest of U.S. history, the public face and voice of the left emanated from an uneasy alliance: between men and women from elite backgrounds and those from such groups as Jewish immigrant workers and plebeian blacks whom most Americans viewed as dangerous outsiders. This was true in the abolitionist movement, when such New England brahmins as Wendell Phillips and Maria Weston Chapman fought alongside Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. And it remained the case in the New Left of the 1960s, an unsustainable alliance of white students from elite colleges and black people like Fannie Lou Hamer and Huey Newton from the ranks of the working poor.<br> &nbsp;<br> It has always been difficult for these top-and-bottom insurgencies to present themselves as plausible alternatives to the major parties, to convince more than a small minority of voters to embrace their program for sweeping change. Radicals did help to catalyze mass movements. But furious internal conflicts, a penchant for dogmatism, and hostility toward both nationalism and organized religion helped make the political left a taste few Americans cared to acquire.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, some of the same qualities that alienated leftists from the electorate made them pioneers in generating an alluringly rebellious culture. Talented orators, writers, artists, and academics associated with the left put forth new ideas and lifestyles that stirred the imagination of many Americans, particularly young ones, who felt stifled by orthodox values and social hierarchies. These ideological pioneers also influenced forces around the world that adapted the culture of the U.S. left to their own purposes&#x2014;from the early sprouts of socialism and feminism in the 1830s to the subcultures of black power, radical feminism, and gay liberation in the 1960s and 1970s. Radical ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and social justice did not need to win votes to become popular. They just required an audience. And leftists who were able to articulate or represent their views in creative ways were often able to find one.</p><h2>Aurelian and Probus: The Soldier Emperors Who Saved Rome</h2><p>This is a narrative military history of the emperors Lucius Domitius Aurelianus (&#x2018;Aurelian&#x2019;, reigned 270-275) and Marcus Aurelius Probus (276-282) which also includes the other reigns between the years 268 and 285. It shows how these two remarkable emperors were chiefly responsible for the Empire surviving and emerging largely intact from a period of intense crisis. It was Aurelian who first united the breakaway regions, including Zenobia&#x2019;s Palmyra, and it was Probus who then secured his achievements.<br><br>The reigns of Aurelian and Probus have been subjected to many studies, but none of these have approached the extant material purely from the point of view of military analysis. Most importantly, the previous historians have not exploited the analytical opportunities provided by the military treatises that describe the strategy and tactics of the period Roman army. It is thanks to this new methodology that Ilkka Syv�nne has been able to reconstruct the military campaigns of these two soldier emperors and their other contemporaries in far greater detail than has been possible before.</p><p>Dr Ilkka Syv�nne gained his doctorate in history in 2004 from Tampere University in his native Finland. He was vice chairman of the Finnish Society for Byzantine Studies from 2007 to 2016. In 2016 he was nominated as an Affiliated Professor of the University of Haifa.

Clever, original, sometimes humorous, and often profound, this collection is sure to charm her fans, both old and new.</p><p><p>Annie Dillard has written twelve books,including in nonfiction <em>For the Time Being, Teaching a Stone to Talk, Holy the Firm</em>, and <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em>. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>Dillard's earlier volume of poetry, <i>Tickets for a Prayer Wheel</i> (1974), contained the usual sort of poetry: poems written by the author. This volume is something altogether different. Dillard "didn't write a word of it." Found poems? Well, yes, except it's not that simple. Other found poetry consists of intact texts offered out of context. What Dillard has done is construct poems out of "bits of broken text" ; that is, she's lifted sentences and used them to create original poems on her own themes. So these are language collages, meticulous and surprisingly effective. Dillard found gems embedded in such unlikely and obscure sources as a boys' project manual, nineteenth-century scientific texts, and memoirs, and she has turned them into poems of wonderful resonance, some very moving, others quite funny. This rather arch endeavor, literary recycling if you will (and so postmodern), demonstrates just how much of poetry's power is in its reductiveness and juxtaposition. By liberating these lines--some so innocent and enthused, others, like the ones Dillard so delicately culled from letters by Vincent van Gogh, so beautifully poignant--Dillard has given them room to breathe and a second chance to make their rich presence felt. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Agincourt 1415: Triumph against the odds (Campaign)</h2><p>Osprey&#39;s Campaign title for one of the most important campaigns of the Hundred Years&#39; War (1337-1453). Agincourt is one of the most evocative names in English military history. Henry V&#39;s forces were tired, hungry, and faced a French army three to six times more numerous. However, they possessed several advantages, and English success resulted from the combination of heavily armoured men-at-arms with troops armed with the infamous longbow - the havoc this weapon wreaked was crucial.

C. W. Sughrue is Crumley's most indelible creation. Now Sughrue is back, in a searing thrill ride of a novel that has the seen-it-all Montana private eye trying to find out which of a small-town shrink's bizarre patients has made off with some highly confidential files. Fast-paced, brutal, melancholy, and ruefully funny, <i>The Right Madness</i> is Crumley at his uncompromising best.</p><p>"This is not my kind of job, man," Montana private eye C.W. Sughrue insists when his psychiatrist pal, Dr. William "Mac" MacKinderick, asks him to find out who surreptitiously duplicated minidisks containing his conversations with seven long-term analysis patients. But, as we soon discover in James Crumley's <i>The Right Madness</i>, this is <i>precisely</i> the sort of investigation toward which C.W. (for Chauncey Wayne) gravitates--filled with violence, sex, despair, and victims at a dime a dozen, not to mention enough booze and illegal drugs to floor a full-grown rhino.<p> Life hasn't treated Sughrue kindly over the years. Introduced in <i>The Last Good Kiss</i> (1978), this now late-middle-aged, Texas-born redneck and Vietnam vet was left for dead at the end of the Hammett Award-winning <i>The Mexican Tree Duck</i> (1993), and he almost bit it on several more occasions in the revenge fantasy <i>Bordersnakes</i> (1996). As <i>Madness</i> opens, C.W.'s younger lawyer wife, Whitney, has taken new employment in Minneapolis, and he's in serious denial about the consequences of this separation on their marriage. Instead, Sughrue loses himself in MacKinderick's supposedly "easy job"--witnessing a series of gruesome deaths (including the botched hanging of a professor's spouse and an artist's fatal tumble), chasing across the highway-striped West in search of some missing forensic evidence, being physically violated by a "blond giantess from Ukraine," and endeavoring to protect his client's redheaded wife from a couple of licentious FBI agents and her own self-destructive habits. Along the way, MacKinderick's blood-soaked sports car is found on a Washington state Indian reservation, and the doctor is presumed dead. But that only drives Sughrue on harder, as he tries, with help from seductive Butte attorney Claudia Lucchesi, to determine how all the pieces of this puzzle fit together. He's barely more successful at that task than readers will be. But then, Crumley's detective stories have always been stronger on character development, high-caliber action, literary wit, and lyrical exposition than on meticulous plot construction. If you've ever wondered how Hunter S. Thompson might have rewritten Raymond Chandler's <i>The Long Goodbye</i>, <i>The Right Madness</i> provides more than a few clues. Watch out: bad craziness ahead. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>James Crumley was born in Three Rivers, Texas, and spent most of his childhood in South Texas. After serving three years in the U.S. Army and completing college degrees in history (BA, Texas College of Arts and Industries) and creative writing (MFA, University of Iowa), he joined the English faculty at the University of Montana at Missoula. He was also a visiting professor at a number of other institutions around the country, including the University of Texas at El Paso, Colorado State University, Reed College, and Carnegie-Mellon.

Out of an ancient theological lineage, the figure of the cloud comes to convey possibility in the face of the impossible. An old mystical nonknowing of God now hosts a current knowledge of uncertainty, of indeterminate and interdependent outcomes, possibly catastrophic. Yet the connectivity and collectivity of social movements, of the fragile, unlikely webs of an alternative notion of existence, keep materializing--a haunting hope, densely entangled, suggesting a more convivial, relational world.<br><br>Catherine Keller brings process, feminist, and ecopolitical theologies into transdisciplinary conversation with continental philosophy, the quantum entanglements of a "participatory universe," and the writings of Nicholas of Cusa, Walt Whitman, A. N. Whitehead, Gilles Deleuze, and Judith Butler, to develop a "theopoetics of nonseparable difference." Global movements, personal embroilments, religious diversity, the inextricable relations of humans and nonhumans--these phenomena, in their unsettling togetherness, are exceeding our capacity to know and manage. By staging a series of encounters between the nonseparable and the nonknowable, Keller shows what can be born from our cloudiest entanglement.</p><p>Catherine Keller is professor of constructive theology at Drew University. Her work interweaves process relationalism and poststructuralist philosophy with an evolving feminist cosmopolitics. At once constructive and deconstructive in approach, it engages questions of ecological, social, and spiritual practice amidst an irreducible indeterminacy. Among her many books are<i> Apocalypse Now &amp; Then</i>; <i>God and Power</i>; and <i>The Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming</i>.A sizzling, citable line on every page, this is Catherine Keller at her poetic, theopoetic, theological best. She meditates not the fire of the apocalypse, nor the water of the deep, but the cloud&#x2015;of the impossible which precipitates the possible itself, the entanglement of knowing and nonknowing, of the relational and what overflows relation, of the enfolding and the unfolding. For her, the name of God is not the name of a cause or a guarantee but the lure of something that needs to be made and done. From philosophy and theology to physics and ecology&#x2015;a sensational tour de force from a major theological voice. (John D. Caputo, Syracuse University and Villanova University)<br><br>At last! A negative theology that plies the complex requirements of planetary life. Long intent on crafting ways of thinking theologically that resist common and oversimplified oppositions between divine and fleshy things, Catherine Keller leads us via ancient, medieval, and recent traditions of unsaying certainties into a rich understanding of divine entanglement as a basis for communal thriving and just democracy. This is a monumental contribution to Christian theology, especially regarding its foundational claims of divine embodiment and love. (Laurel C. Schneider, Vanderbilt University)<br><br>Catherine Keller is our most creative and profound theologian today, and this book is her richest to date, tracking the enfolding and unfolding relation of everything to everything with theopoetic brilliance. (Gary Dorrien, author of <i>Kantian Reason and Hegelian Spirit: The Idealistic Logic of Modern Theology</i>)<br><br>Catherine Keller's nuanced consideration of the apophatic cloud is both true to its subject and marvelously lucid. Tracing unexpected connections in the thought of medieval theologians, process philosophers, environmental activists, quantum physicists, and more, the book enfolds and unfolds, each line of thought traced with delicate precision, each intersection marked. Out of impossibility itself, enfolded in each and every relation, a new and open possible emerges. Through folds and mirrors, holograms and entanglements, poetry and theology, trauma and joy, this possible-impossible, this luminous darkness, entice us to follow&#x2015;and to be glad that we did. (Karmen MacKendrick, Le Moyne College)<br><br>Facing the complex majesty of <i>Cloud of the Impossible</i>, one cannot help but feel like some Moses-manqu� before a literary Sinai. The prose is finely wrought, tracing the inter- and indeterminacies of a provisionally named 'apophatic entanglement.' This is a beautiful and important book, which traces the contours of a transfigured, queerly-theological discourse and practice--precisely where such a thing might seem impossible. (Mary-Jane Rubenstein, Wesleyan University)<br><br>With this work, Catherine Keller has produced a masterpiece on the level of her <i>Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming</i>. There is something of James Joyce in these pages. Readers are taken through core Hebrew and Greek debates, the emergence of infinity in Patristic theology, Christian and non-Christian mysticism, quantum physics, contemporary poststructuralist philosophy, the plight of theology today, nineteenth-century poetry, the environmental crisis... and that is only a start. Many critics will say that this is her best book yet. (Philip Clayton, Ingraham Professor, Claremont School of Theology)<br><br>Keller's bewildering and creatively beautiful body of work is often more poetry than prose... It is always worth the effort. (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>An impressive and astonishing work. (<i>Syndicate Theology</i>)<br><br>This is an extraordinary book.... Readers will engage an astounding sweep of resources and conversation partners in this book. (<i>Interpretation</i>)</p><h2>Years In The Making: The Time-Travel Stories Of L.

Gifted with only an ancient sword, a loyal dragon, and sage advice from an old storyteller, Eragon is soon swept into a dangerous tapestry of magic, glory, and power.

Christopher Paolini began <i>Eragon</i> when he was just 15, and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords. <p> Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a marvelous blue stone in a mystical mountain place. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, it hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon bonds with the dragon, and when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war between the human but hidden Varden, dwarves, elves, the diabolical Shades and their neanderthal Urgalls, all pitted against and allied with each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon and his dragon Saphira set out to find their role, growing in magic power and understanding of the complex political situation as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape. </p><p> In spite of the engrossing action, this is not a book for the casual fantasy reader. There are 65 names of people, horses, and dragons to be remembered and lots of pseudo-Celtic places, magic words, and phrases in the Ancient Language as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls. But the maps and glossaries help, and by the end, readers will be utterly dedicated and eager for the next book, <i>Eldest</i>. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Eragon is a very special book. It is a great story, one that will you'll remember long after you finish it. Eragon inspires passion in fans. We invite you to read Eragon and see for yourself what the buzz is all about. <p>Eragon was nominated for the American Library Association 2003 Best Books For Young Adults Award.</p></p><h2>The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art, revised edition (Leonardo)</h2><p><p><b>The long-awaited new edition of a groundbreaking work on the impact of alternative concepts of space on modern art.</b></p><p>In this groundbreaking study, first published in 1983 and unavailable for over a decade, Linda Dalrymple Henderson demonstrates that two concepts of space beyond immediate perception&#x2015;the curved spaces of non-Euclidean geometry and, most important, a higher, fourth dimension of space&#x2015;were central to the development of modern art. The possibility of a spatial fourth dimension suggested that our world might be merely a shadow or section of a higher dimensional existence. That iconoclastic idea encouraged radical innovation by a variety of early twentieth-century artists, ranging from French Cubists, Italian Futurists, and Marcel Duchamp, to Max Weber, Kazimir Malevich, and the artists of De Stijl and Surrealism. </p><p>In an extensive new Reintroduction, Henderson surveys the impact of interest in higher dimensions of space in art and culture from the 1950s to 2000. Although largely eclipsed by relativity theory beginning in the 1920s, the spatial fourth dimension experienced a resurgence during the later 1950s and 1960s. In a remarkable turn of events, it has returned as an important theme in contemporary culture in the wake of the emergence in the 1980s of both string theory in physics (with its ten- or eleven-dimensional universes) and computer graphics. Henderson demonstrates the importance of this new conception of space for figures ranging from Buckminster Fuller, Robert Smithson, and the Park Place Gallery group in the 1960s to Tony Robbin and digital architect Marcos Novak.</p></p><p>During the first three decades of this century, the concept of the fourth dimension had a liberating effect on artists in nearly every important movement, from French Cubism to Surrealism.Linda Dalrymple Henderson is David Bruton, Jr., Centennial Professor in Art History and Regents Outstanding Teaching Professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

But not as clear as the spring in which a hill witch shows him his true face--and his secret destiny....<br><br>Now Tobin carries a burden he cannot share with even his closest friend, Ki, his squire. He is to rule--not as he is but as he was born: a woman. Given the shape of a boy by dark magic, Tobin is the last hope of the people of Illior--those who desperately seek a return to the old ways, when Skala was ruled by a line of warrior queens. They still believe that only a woman can lift the war, famine, and pestilence that have run rampant through the land since the king usurped his half sister&#x2019;s throne. It is these outlaw wizards and witches who protect Tobin--and it is for them that Tobin must accept his fate.<br><br>With the unsuspecting yet fiercely loyal Ki at his side, Tobin must turn traitor against the only blood ties he has left. He must lift the masks of Skala&#x2019;s rulers to show their true colors--before he can reveal the power of the woman within himself.</p><p>Lynn Flewelling was born in Presque Isle, Maine, in 1958.

They cut through the darkness like a beacon, drawing him awake. That was Nari's voice. What was his nurse doing in Ero? <br>Tobin opened his eyes and saw with a mix of relief and confusion that he was in his old room at the keep. A brazier stood near the open window, casting a pattern of red light through its pierced brass lid. The little night lamp cast a brighter glow, making shadows dance around the rafters. The bed linens and his nightshirt smelled of lavender and fresh air. The door was closed, but he could still hear Nari talking quietly to someone outside. <br><br>Sleep-fuddled, he let his gaze wander around the room, content for the moment just to be home. A few of his wax sculptures stood on the windowsill, and the wooden practice swords leaned in the corner by the door. The spiders had been busy among the ceiling beams; cobwebs large and fine as a lady's veil stirred gently in a current of air. <br><br>A bowl was on the table beside his bed, with a horn spoon laid out ready beside it. It was the spoon Nari had always fed him with when he was sick. <br><br>Am I sick? <br><br>Had Ero been nothing but a fever dream? he wondered drowsily. And his father's death, and his mother's, too? He ached a little, and the middle of his chest hurt, but he felt more hungry than ill. As he reached for the bowl, he caught sight of something that shattered his sleepy fantasies. <br><br>The ugly old rag doll lay in plain view on the clothes chest across the room. Even from here, he could make out the fresh white thread stitching up the doll's dingy side. <br><br>Tobin clutched at the comforter as fragments of images flooded back. The last thing he remembered clearly was lying in Lhel's oak tree house in the woods above the keep. The witch had cut the doll open and shown him bits of infant bones--Brother's bones--hidden in the stuffing. Hidden by his mother when she'd made the thing. Using a fragment of bone instead of skin, Lhel had bound Brother's soul to Tobin's again. <br><br>Tobin reached into the neck of his nightshirt with trembling fingers and felt gingerly at the sore place on his chest. Yes, there it was; a narrow ridge of raised skin running down the center of his breastbone where Lhel had sewn him up like a torn shirt. He could feel the tiny ridges of the stitches, but no blood. The wound was nearly healed already, not raw like the one on Brother's chest. Tobin prodded at it, finding the hard little lump the piece of bone made under his skin. He could wiggle it like a tiny loose tooth. <br><br>Skin strong, but bone stronger, Lhel had said. <br><br>Tucking his chin, Tobin looked down and saw that neither the bump nor the stitching was visible. Just like before, no one could see what she'd done to him. <br><br>A wave of dizziness rolled over him as he remembered how Brother had looked, floating facedown just above him while Lhel worked. The ghost's face was twisted with pain; tears of blood fell from his black eyes and the unhealed wound on his breast. <br><br>Dead can't be hurt, keesa, Lhel told him, but she was wrong. <br><br>Tobin curled up against the pillow and stared miserably at the doll. All those years of hiding it, all the fear and worry, and here it lay for anyone to see. <br><br>But how had it gotten here? He'd left it behind when he'd run away from the city. <br><br>Suddenly scared without knowing why, he almost cried out for Nari, but shame choked him. He was a Royal Companion, far too old to be needing a nurse. <br><br>And what would she say about the doll? Surely she'd seen it by now. Brother showed him <br>a vision once of how people would react if they knew, their looks of disgust. Only girls wanted dolls . . <br><br>Tears filled his eyes, transforming the lamp flame into a shifting yellow star. "I'm not a girl!" he whispered. <br><br>"Yes, you are." <br><br>And there was Brother beside the bed, even though Tobin hadn't spoken the summoning words. The ghost's chill presence rolled over him in waves. <br><br>"No!" Tobin covered his ears. "I know who I am." <br><br>"I'm the boy!" Brother hissed. Then, with a mean leer, "Sister." <br><br>"No!" Tobin shuddered and buried his face in the pillow. "No no no no!" <br><br>Gentle hands lifted him. Nari held him tight, stroking his head. "What is it, pet? What's wrong?" She was still dressed for the day, but her brown hair was unbound over her shoulders. Brother was still there, but she didn't seem to notice him. <br>Tobin clung to her for a moment, hiding his face against her shoulder the way he used to, before pride made him pull back. <br><br>"You knew," he whispered, remembering. "Lhel told me. You always knew! Why didn't you tell me?" <br><br>"Because I told her not to." Iya stepped partway into the little circle of light. It left half her square, wrinkled face in shadow, but he knew her by her worn traveling gown and the thin, iron-grey braid that hung over one shoulder to her waist. <br><br>Brother knew her, too. He disappeared, but an instant later the doll flew off the chest and struck the old woman in the face. The wooden swords followed, clacking like a crane's bill as she fended them off with an upraised hand. Then the heavy wardrobe began to shake ominously, grating across the floor in Iya's direction. <br><br>"Stop it!" cried Tobin. <br><br>The wardrobe stopped moving and Brother reappeared by the bed, hatred crackling in the air around him as he glared at the old wizard. Iya flinched, but did not back away. <br><br>"You can see him?" asked Tobin. <br><br>"Yes. He's been with you ever since Lhel completed the new binding." <br><br>"Can you see him, Nari?" <br><br>She shivered. "No, thank the Light. But I can feel him." <br><br>Tobin turned back to the wizard. "Lhel said you told her to do it! She said you wanted me to look like my brother." <br><br>"I did what Illior required of me." Iya settled at the foot of the bed. The light struck her full on now. She looked tired and old, yet there was hardness in her eyes that made him glad Nari was still beside him. <br><br>"It was Illior's will," Iya said again. "What was done was done for Skala's sake, as much as for you. The day is coming when you must rule, Tobin, as your mother should have ruled." <br><br>"I don't want to!" <br><br>"I shouldn't wonder, child." Iya sighed and some of the hardness left her face. "You were never meant to find out the truth so young. It must have been a terrible shock, especially the way you found out." <br><br>Tobin looked away, mortified. He'd thought the blood seeping between his legs had been the first sign of the plague. The truth had been worse. <br><br>"Even Lhel was taken by surprise. Arkoniel tells me she showed you your true face before she wove the new magic." <br><br>"This is my true face!" <br><br>"My face!" Brother snarled. <br><br>Nari jumped and Tobin guessed even she'd heard that. He took a closer look at Brother; the ghost looked more solid than he had for a long time, almost real. It occurred to Tobin that he'd been hearing his twin's voice out loud, too, not just a whisper in his mind like before. <br><br>"He's rather distracting," said Iya. "Could you send him away, please? And ask him not to make a fuss around the place this time?" <br><br>Tobin was tempted to refuse, but for Nari's sake he whispered the words Lhel had taught him. "Blood, my blood. Flesh, my flesh. Bone, my bone." Brother vanished like a snuffed candle and the room felt warmer. <br><br>"That's better!" Taking up the bowl, Nari went to the brazier and dipped up the broth she had warming in a pot on the coals. "Here, get some of this into you. You've hardly eaten in days." <br><br>Ignoring the spoon, Tobin took the bowl and drank from it. This was Cook's special sickroom broth, rich with beef marrow, parsley, wine, and milk, along with the healing herbs. <br><br>He drained the bowl and Nari refilled it. Iya leaned over and retrieved the fallen doll. Propping it on her lap, she arranged its uneven arms and legs and looked down pensively at the crudely drawn face. <br><br>Tobin's throat went tight and he lowered the bowl. How many times had he watched his mother sit just like that? Fresh tears filled his eyes. She'd made the doll to keep Brother's spirit close to her. It had been Brother she'd seen when she looked at it, Brother she'd held and rocked and crooned to and carried with her everywhere until the day she threw herself out of the tower window. <br><br>Always Brother. <br><br>Never Tobin. <br><br>Was her angry ghost still up there? <br><br>Nari saw him shiver and hugged him close again. This time he let her. <br>"Illior really told you to do this to me?" he whispered. <br><br>Iya nodded sadly. "The Lightbearer spoke to me through the Oracle at Afra. You know what that is, don't you?" <br><br>"The same Oracle that told King Theletimos to make his daughter the first queen." <br><br>"That's right. And now Skala needs a queen again, one of the true blood to heal and defend the land. I promise you, one day you will understand all this." <br><br>Nari hugged him and kissed the top of his head. "It was all to keep you safe, pet." <br>The thought of her complicity stung him. Wiggling free, he scooted back against the bolsters on the far side of the bed and pulled his legs--long, sharp-shinned boy legs--up under his shirt. "But why?" He touched the scar, then broke off with a gasp of dismay. "Father's seal and my mother's ring! I had them on a chain . . ." <br><br>"I have them right here, pet. I kept them safe for you." Nari took the chain from her apron pocket and held it out to him. <br><br>Tobin cradled the talismans in his hand. The seal, a black stone set high in a gold ring, bore the deep-carved oak tree insignia of Atyion, the great holding Tobin now owned but had never seen. <br><br>The other ring had been his mother's bride gift from his father. The golden mounting was delicate, a circlet of tiny leaves holding an amethyst carved with a relief of his parents' youthful profiles. He'd spent hours gazing at the portrait; he'd never seen his parents happy together, the way they looked here. <br><br>"Where did you find that?" the wizard asked softly. <br><br>"In a hole under a tree." <br><br>"What tree?" <br><br>"A dead chestnut in the back courtyard of my mother's house in Ero." Tobin looked up to find her watching him closely. "The one near the summer kitchen." <br><br>"Ah yes. That's where Arkoniel buried your brother." <br><br>And where my mother and Lhel dug him up again, he thought. Perhaps she lost the ring then. "Did my parents know what you did to me?" <br><br>He caught the quick, sharp look Iya shot at Nari before she answered. "Yes. They knew." <br>Tobin's heart sank. "They let you?" <br><br>"Before you were born, your father asked me to protect you. He understood the Oracle's words and obeyed without question. I'm sure he taught you the prophecy the Oracle gave to King Theletimos." <br><br>"Yes." <br><br>Iya was quiet for a moment. "It was different for your mother. She wasn't a strong person and the birthing was very difficult. And she never got over your brother's death." <br>Tobin had to swallow hard before he could ask, "Is that why she hated me?" <br><br>"She never hated you, pet. Never!" Nari pressed a hand to her heart. "She wasn't right in her mind, that's all." <br><br>"That's enough for now," said Iya. "Tobin, you've been very ill and slept the last two days away." <br><br>"Two?" Tobin looked out the window. A slim crescent moon had guided him here; now it had waxed nearly to half. "What day is it?" <br><br>"The twenty-first of Erasin, pet. Your name day came and went while you slept," said Nari. "I'll tell Cook to make the honey cakes for tomorrow's supper." <br><br>Tobin shook his head in bewilderment, still staring at the moon. "I--I was in the forest. Who brought me to the house?" <br><br>"Tharin showed up out of nowhere with you in his arms, and Arkoniel behind him with poor Ki," said Nari. "Scared me almost to death, just like that day your father brought your--" <br><br>"Ki?" Tobin's head reeled as another memory struggled to the surface. In his fevered dreams Tobin had floated up into the air over Lhel's oak and found himself looking down from a great height. He'd seen something in the woods just beyond the spring, lying on the dead leaves--"No, Ki's safe in Ero. I was careful!" <br><br>But a cold knot of fear took root in his belly, pressing on his heart. In his dream it had been Ki lying on the ground, and Arkoniel was weeping beside him. "He brought the doll, didn't he? That's why he followed me." <br><br>"Yes, pet." <br><br>"Then it wasn't a dream." But why had Arkoniel been weeping? <br><br>It was a moment before he realized that people were still speaking to him. Nari was shaking him by the shoulder, looking alarmed. "Tobin, what is it? You've gone white!" <br><br>"Where's Ki?" he whispered, gripping his knees hard as he braced for the answer. <br><br>"I was just telling you," Nari said, her round face lined with new concern. "He's asleep in your old toy room next door. With you so ill and thrashing about in your sleep, and him hurt so bad, I thought you'd rest easier apart." <br><br>Tobin clambered across the bed, not waiting to hear more. <br><br>Iya caught him by the arm. "Wait. He's still very ill, Tobin. He fell and hit his head. Arkoniel and Tharin have been tending him." <br><br>He tried to pull free, but she held on. "Let him rest. Tharin has been frantic, going back and forth between your rooms like a sorrowful hound all this time. He was asleep by Ki's bed when I passed." <br><br>"Let me go. I promise I won't wake them, but please, I have to see Ki!" <br><br>"Stay a moment and listen to me." Iya was grave now. "Listen well, little prince, for what I tell you is worth your life, and theirs." <br><br>Trembling, Tobin sank back on the edge of the bed. <br><br>Iya released him and folded her hands across the doll in her lap. "As I said, you were never meant to bear this burden so young, but here we are. Listen well and seal these words in your heart. Ki and Tharin don't know, and they mustn't know, about this secret of ours. Except for Arkoniel, only Lhel and Nari know the truth, and so it must remain until the time comes for you to claim your birthright."</p><h2>Radionics &amp; the Subtle Anatomy of Man</h2><p>Radionics is a method of diagnosis and therapy which is primarily concerned with the use of subtle force fields and energies, for the purpose of investigating and combating the causes of disease.

In <i>Gramsci's Common Sense</i> Kate Crehan offers new ways to understand the many forms that structural inequality can take, including in regards to race, gender, sexual orientation, and religion. Presupposing no previous knowledge of Gramsci on the part of the reader, she introduces the <i>Prison Notebooks</i> and provides an overview of Gramsci&#x2019;s notions of subalternity, intellectuals, and common sense, putting them in relation to the work of thinkers such as Bourdieu, Arendt, Spivak, and Said. In the case studies of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements, Crehan theorizes the complex relationships between the experience of inequality, exploitation, and oppression, as well as the construction of political narratives. <i>Gramsci's Common Sense</i> is an accessible and concise introduction to a key Marxist thinker whose works illuminate the increasing inequality in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Kate Crehan is Professor Emerita, College of Staten Island and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and the author of <i>Community Art: An Anthropological Perspective </i>and <i>Gramsci, Culture, and Anthropology</i>."Kate Crehan&#x2019;s new book on Antonio Gramsci&#x2019;s work is an astute and accessible text that attempts to connect his ideas to current events in the United States. Staying true to the Gramscian spirit, Crehan spends the first four chapters contextualizing both his life and his work in order to show how his ideas evolved. Crehan then spends several chapters showing why these ideas remain useful in today&#x2019;s world; as Gramsci would have wanted, knowledge should be used for social change, not for the sake of knowing alone. What is most striking about the book is the lucid and engaging way in which Crehan writes."

Spencer, Brock University, Ontario John Locke (1632-1704) was perhaps the most influential English writer of his time. His Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690) and Two Treatises of Government (1690) weighed heavily on the history of ideas in the eighteenth century, and Locke&#39;s works are often - rightly - presented as foundations of the Age of Enlightenment. Both the Essay and the Second Treatise (by far the more influential of the Two Treatises) were widely read by Locke&#39;s contemporaries and near contemporaries. His eighteenth-century readers included philosophers, historians and political theorists, but also community and political leaders, engaged laypersons, and others eager to participate in the expanding print culture of the era. His epistemological message that the mind at birth was a blank slate, waiting to be filled, complemented his political message that human beings were free and equal and had the right to create and direct the governments under which they lived. Today, Locke continues to be an accessible author. He provides food for thought to university professors and their students, but has no less to offer the general reader who is eager to enjoy the classics of world literature.</p><p></p><h2>Equality: An American Dilemma, 1866-1896</h2><p><p><b>An in-depth study of American social movements after the Civil War and their lessons for today by a prizewinning historian</b></p><p>The Civil War unleashed a torrent of claims for equality&#x2015;in the chaotic years following the war, former slaves, women&#x2019;s rights activists, farmhands, and factory workers all engaged in the pursuit of the meaning of equality in America. This contest resulted in experiments in collective action, as millions joined leagues and unions. In <i>Equality: An American Dilemma, 1866&#x2013;1886</i>, Charles Postel demonstrates how taking stock of these movements forces us to rethink some of the central myths of American history. </p><p>Despite a nationwide push for equality, egalitarian impulses oftentimes clashed with one another. These dynamics get to the heart of the great paradox of the fifty years following the Civil War and of American history at large: Waves of agricultural, labor, and women&#x2019;s rights movements were accompanied by the deepening of racial discrimination and oppression. Herculean efforts to overcome the economic inequality of the first Gilded Age and the sexual inequality of the late-Victorian social order emerged alongside Native American dispossession, Chinese exclusion, Jim Crow segregation, and lynch law. </p><p> Now, as Postel argues, the twenty-first century has ushered in a second Gilded Age of savage socioeconomic inequalities. Convincing and learned, <i>Equality </i>explores the roots of these social fissures and speaks urgently to the need for expansive strides toward equality to meet our contemporary crisis.</p></p><p><b>Charles Postel</b> is the author of <i>The Populist Vision</i>, which received the 2008 Bancroft Prize and the 2008 Frederick Jackson Turner Award from the Organization of American Historians.

This is hardly a rhetorical question: for at least as long as art criticism has existed, there has been a great deal of philosophizing and speculation on the topic. <i>What Is Art?</i> allows young readers and interested adults to quickly immerse themselves in the world of art. Young people have formulated 27 basic questions about art, which are by turns earnest, bemused, amusing and profound: how did art begin? At what point does something become art? What does an artist do when he or she doesn&#x2019;t like a work? Why is the &#x201c;Mona Lisa&#x201d; so famous? Is graffiti art? Are forgeries art? Why are most artists men? And why do so many artists become famous only after their death? The easy-to-follow question-and-answer format invites the reader to dip into or browse the book at whim, finding out about historical developments and significant concepts, or gaining specific knowledge about artists, museums and works of art, in the process. Experts from the Beyeler Foundation provide accessible, anecdotal replies to each of the questions posed, which are accompanied by color photographs of young people at museums by Andri Pol.</p><p>This well-designed compendium will take the fear out of art for kids of all ages. (Andras Szanto <i>The Art Newspaper</i>)</p><h2>History of the Caribbean: Plantations, Trade, and War in the Atlantic World</h2><p><p>From the arrival of the first Europeans in the region until the 1930s, plantations -- building their fortunes on sugar, and to a lesser extent on cotton, indigo, tobacco, coffee, and bananas -- brought unprecedented wealth to Old World owners, effected a fundamental shift in the landscape and economy of the Caribbean and the Atlantic world, saw the enslavement of first indigenous populations and then imported Africans, and led to bloody wars on both sides of the Atlantic over control of the lucrative sugar market. In this comprehensive volume, Frank Moya Pons explores the history, context, and consequences of the major changes that marked the Caribbean between Columbus' initial landing and the Great Depression. He investigates indigenous commercial ventures and institutions, the rise of the plantation economy in the 16th century, and the impact of slavery. He discusses the slave revolts and struggles for independence, seen by European landowners not as a matter of human or political rights but as an expensive interruption to their profit flow. History of the Caribbean traces the fate of a group of small islands whose natural resources transformed them first into some of the wealthiest places on earth and then into some of the poorest. This book intertwines the socioeconomics of the Caribbean with Atlantic history in a captivating narrative that will fascinate a general audience and provide new insights for specialists.</p></p><p>Only the hard cover edition includes the extended bibliographical essay of over 60 pages; the paperback edition includes a less detailed but still thorough bibliographical guide of 27 pages.Frank Moya Pons, Former research Director at CUNY Dominican Studies Institute, is the author of twenty books.

Her profiles of contemporary gardeners and landscapers and their creations are supplemented with fascinating historic photos of the lavish landscaping of famed Adirondack-style estates such as Nirvana and the Knapp Estate and grand old hotel resorts such as Scaroon Manor and Sagamore.</p><p>Photographer Janet Loughrey grew up in New York state, and although she now lives in Portland, Oregon, the beauty and unique history of the Adirondack region still call her back. Since Janet&#x2019;s professional specialty is as a horticulture photographer and writer, it was only natural that she would someday launch an ambitious project to document the gardens&#x2014;past and present&#x2014;of this remarkable region. Janet&#x2019;s work has appeared in Better Homes &amp; Gardens, Wall Street Journal, Garden Design, Sunset, and Country Living Gardener and in dozens of books. Her photography has won Garden Writers Association national awards four times.After a career photographing America's most spectacular gardens for magazines, Loughrey's handsome volume of upstate New York gardens serves as a history of Adirondack landscapes as well as a visual record of their charms. Herbaceous borders, animal-shaped topiaries and heavily pruned English boxwoods typified gardens at the dawn of the twentieth century, when wealthy tourists flocked to the Adirondacks, hastening the development of grand hotels and an influx of the talented gardeners who created the immaculate gardens of the historic resorts around Lake George and the sprawling garden oases separating the Millionaire's Row mansions. Moving on to contemporary gardens, Loughrey shifts her focus to individual properties, including the short-seasoned vegetable gardens of the Lake Clear area, the North Country's daylily-rich summer retreats and Lake Placid's lush "Gold Medal Gardens." Loughrey offers detailed topiary information so home gardeners can replicate the dramatic results contained within these pages, and a thorough resource guide lists information on nurseries, garden clubs, resorts and landscape design services tailored to the New England gardening style. The book might offer enough escapism to satisfy gardeners unable to personally tour the world class gardens the book chronicles, and Loughrey's historical account of each property adds a rewarding counterpoint to this lavishly illustrated book. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Black on Earth</i>, Kimberly Ruffin expands the reach of ecocriticism by analyzing the ecological experiences, conceptions, and desires seen in African American writing.</p><p>Ruffin identifies a theory of &#x201c;ecological burden and beauty&#x201d; in which African American authors underscore the ecological burdens of living within human hierarchies in the social order just as they explore the ecological beauty of being a part of the natural order. Blacks were ecological agents before the emergence of American nature writing, argues Ruffin, and their perspectives are critical to understanding the full scope of ecological thought.</p><p>Ruffin examines African American ecological insights from the antebellum era to the twenty-first century, considering WPA slave narratives, neo&#x2013;slave poetry, novels, essays, and documentary films, by such artists as Octavia Butler, Alice Walker, Henry Dumas, Percival Everett, Spike Lee, and Jayne Cortez. Identifying themes of work, slavery, religion, mythology, music, and citizenship, <i>Black on Earth</i> highlights the ways in which African American writers are visionary ecological artists.</p></p><p>KIMBERLY N.

The timing is right for this book, which arrives when ecocritics are rethinking the meaning of environmental literature through the lens of environmental justice and expanding the field to include new voices that represent experiences outside the traditional categories of nature writing. By reframing contemporary writers such as Alice Walker, Henry Dumas, Percival Everett, Octavia Butler, and others as ecological writers&#x2015;and, conversely, by rethinking environmental literature through the lens of black experience with work, religion, myth, and the blues&#x2015;Ruffin's study will help to expand the horizons of this literature in a significant way.</p> (Jeffrey Myers <i>author of <i>Converging Stories: Race, Ecology, and Environmental Justice in American Literature</i></i>)<br><br><p>An invaluable intervention on the canon of American nature writing, one that opens it to a range of too-long unheard and unheeded voices. <i>Black on Earth</i> demonstrates both the centrality of environmental concerns to African American literature and culture and the vital insights that tradition offers contemporary ecocritical discourse.</p> (Paul Outka <i>author of <i>Race and Nature from Transcendentalism to the Harlem Renaissance</i></i>)<br><br><p>This is a much-needed, excellent book. Kimberly Ruffin argues that African American oral and print literary texts have not received the attention they deserve in current ecocritical and environmentalist discussions, and she is absolutely right. The neglect not only ignores an important literary tradition, past and present, but deeply disadvantages contemporary efforts to find solutions to the ecological crises we now face in the United States and around the globe. As Ruffin maintains and demonstrates, African American perspectives offer crucial wisdom that we all need if human beings are to be successful in addressing ecological issues. <i>Black on Earth</i> is original, highly accessible, and enormously needed.

He lives in Colorado along the Front Range of the Rockies.Shadow at Evening<br> &nbsp;<br> Bremen left the hospital and his dying wife and drove east to the sea. The roads were thick with Philadelphians fleeing the city for the unusually warm Easter weekend, so Bremen had to concentrate on traffic, leaving only the most tenuous of touches in his wife&#x2019;s mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gail was sleeping. Her dreams were fitful and drug-induced. She was seeking her mother through endlessly interlinked rooms filled with Victorian furniture. Images from these dreams slid between the evening shadows of reality as Bremen crossed the Pine Barrens. She awoke just as Bremen was leaving the parkway, and for the few seconds that the pain was not with her, Bremen was able to share the clarity of sunlight falling across the blue blanket at the foot of her bed; then he shared the quick vertigo of confusion as she thought&#x2014;only for a second&#x2014;that it was morning on the farm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her thoughts reached for him just as the pain returned, stabbing behind her left eye like a thin but infinitely sharp needle. Bremen grimaced and dropped the coin he was handing the tollbooth attendant.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Something wrong, pal?&#x201d; Bremen shook his head, fumbled out a dollar, and thrust it blindly at the man. Tossing his change into the Triumph&#x2019;s cluttered console, he concentrated on pushing the little car up through its gears while shielding himself from the worst of Gail&#x2019;s pain. Slowly the agony faded, but her confusion washed over him like a wave of nausea.<br> &nbsp;<br> She quickly gained control despite the shifting curtains of fear that fluttered at the edges of her consciousness. She subvocalized, concentrating on narrowing the spectrum of what she shared to a simulacrum of her voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hi, Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hi, yourself, kiddo. He sent the thought as he turned onto the exit of Long Beach Island. Bremen shared the visual&#x2014;the startling green of grass and pine trees overlaid with the gold of April light, the sports car&#x2019;s shadow leaping along the curve of the embankment as he followed the cloverleaf down to the road. Suddenly there came the unmistakable salt-and-rotting-vegetation scent of the Atlantic, and he shared that with her as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nice. Gail&#x2019;s thoughts were slurred with the static of too much pain and medication. She clung to the images he sent with an almost feverish concentration of will.<br> &nbsp;<br> The entrance to the seaside community was disappointing: dilapidated seafood restaurants, overpriced cinder-block motels, endless marinas. But it was reassuring in its familiarity to both of them, and Bremen concentrated on seeing all of it. Gail began to relax a bit as the terrible swells of pain abated, and for a second her presence was so real that Bremen caught himself half turning to speak to her in the passenger&#x2019;s seat. The pang of regret and embarrassment was sent before he could stifle it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The driveways of beach homes were filled with families unpacking station wagons and carrying late dinners to the beach. The evening shadows carried the nip of early spring, but Bremen concentrated on the fresh air and the warmth of the low strips of sunlight as he drove north to Barnegat Light. He glanced right and caught a glimpse of half a dozen fishermen standing in the surf, their shadows intersecting the white lines of breakers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Monet, thought Gail, and Bremen nodded, although he had actually been thinking about Euclid.<br> &nbsp;<br> Always the mathematician. Gail&#x2019;s voice faded as the pain returned. Half-formed sentences scattered like the spray rising from the white breakers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bremen left the Triumph parked near the lighthouse and walked through low dunes to the beach. He threw down the tattered blanket that they had carried so many times to just this spot. A group of children ran past, squealing as they came close to the surf. Despite the cold water and rapidly chilling air, they were dressed in swimsuits. One girl of about nine, all long white legs in a suit a year too small, pranced on the wet sand in an intricate and unconscious choreography with the sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> The light was fading between the Venetian blinds. A nurse smelling of cigarettes and stale talcum powder came in to change the IV drip and to take a pulse. The intercom in the hall continued to make loud, imperative announcements, but it was difficult to understand them through the growing haze of pain. Dr. Singh arrived about six P.M. and spoke to her softly, but Gail&#x2019;s attention was riveted on the doorway where the nurse with the blessed needle would arrive. The cotton swab on her arm was a delightful preliminary to the promised surcease of pain. Gail knew to the second how many minutes before the morphine would begin to work in earnest. The doctor was saying something.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;...&nbsp;your husband? I thought he would be staying the night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right here, doctor,&#x201d; said Gail. She patted the blanket and the sand.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bremen pulled on his nylon windbreaker against the chill of coming night. The stars were occluded by a high cloud layer that allowed only a bit of sky to show through. Far out to sea, an improbably long oil tanker moved along the horizon. Windows of the beach homes behind Bremen cast yellow rectangles on the dunes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The smell of steak being grilled came to him on the breeze. Bremen tried to remember whether he had eaten that day or not. His stomach twisted in a mild shadow of the pain that still filled Gail even now that the medication was working. Bremen considered going back to the convenience store near the lighthouse to get a sandwich, but remembered an old Payday candy bar he had purchased from the vending machine in the hospital corridor during the previous week&#x2019;s vigil. It was still in his jacket pocket. Bremen contented himself with chewing on the rock-hard wedge of peanuts while he watched the evening settle in.<br> &nbsp;<br> Footsteps continued to echo in the hall. It sounded as if entire armies were on the march. The rush of footsteps, clatter of trays, and vague chatter of aides bringing dinner to the other patients reminded Gail of lying in bed as a child and listening to one of her parents&#x2019; parties downstairs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Remember the party where we met? sent Bremen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mmmm. Gail&#x2019;s attention was thin. Already the black fingers of panic were creeping around the edge of her awareness as the pain began to overwhelm the painkiller. The thin needle behind her eye seemed to grow hotter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bremen tried to send memory images of Chuck Gilpen&#x2019;s party a decade earlier, of their first meeting, of that first second when their minds had opened to one another and they had realized I am not alone. And then the corollary realization, I am not a freak. There, in Chuck Gilpen&#x2019;s crowded town house, amid the tense babble and even tenser neurobabble of mingling teachers and graduate students, their lives had been changed forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bremen was just inside the door&#x2014;someone had pressed a drink in his hand&#x2014;when suddenly he had sensed another mindshield quite near him. He had put out a gentle probe, and immediately Gail&#x2019;s thoughts had swept across him like a searchlight in a dark room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both were stunned. Their first reaction had been to increase the strength of their mindshields, to roll up like frightened armadillos. Each soon found that useless against the unconscious and almost involuntary probes of the other. Neither had ever encountered another telepath of more than primitive, untapped ability. Each had assumed that he or she was a freak&#x2014;unique and unassailable. Now they stood naked before each other in an empty place. A second later, almost without volition, they flooded each other&#x2019;s mind with a torrent of images, self-images, half memories, secrets, sensations, preferences, perceptions, hidden shames, half-formed longings, and fully formed fears. Nothing was held back. Every petty cruelty committed, sexual experiment experienced, and prejudice harbored poured out along with thoughts of past birthday parties, former lovers, parents, and an endless stream of trivia. Rarely had two people known each other as well after fifty years of marriage.<br> &nbsp;<br> A minute later they met for the first time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The beacon from Barnegat Light passed over Bremen&#x2019;s head every twenty-four seconds. There were more lights burning out at sea now than along the dark line of beach. The wind had come up after midnight, and Bremen clutched the blanket around himself tightly. Gail had refused the needle when the nurse had last made her rounds, but her mindtouch was still clouded. Bremen forced the contact through sheer strength of will.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gail had always been afraid of the dark. Many were the times during their nine years of marriage that he had reached out in the night with his mind or arm to reassure her. Now she was the frightened little girl again, left alone upstairs in the big old house on Burlingame Avenue. There were things in the darkness beneath her bed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bremen reached through her pain and confusion to share the sound of the sea with her. He told her stories about that day&#x2019;s antics of Gernisavien, their calico cat. He lay in the hollow of the sand to match his body with hers on the hospital bed. Slowly she began to relax, to surrender her thoughts to his. She even managed to doze a few times without the morphine, and her dreams were the movement of stars between clouds and the sharp smell of the Atlantic.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bremen described the week&#x2019;s work at the farm&#x2014;what little work he had done between hospital vigils&#x2014;and shared the subtle beauty of the Fourier equations across the chalkboard in his study and the sunlit satisfaction of planting a peach tree by the front drive. He shared memories of their ski trip to Aspen the year before and the sudden shock of a searchlight reaching in to the beach from an unseen ship out at sea. He shared what little poetry he had memorized, but the words kept sliding into pure images and purer feelings.<br> &nbsp;<br> The night drew on, and Bremen shared the cold clarity of it with his wife, adding to each image the warm overlay of his love. He shared trivia and hopes for the future. From seventy-five miles away he reached out and touched her hand with his. When he drifted off to sleep for only a few minutes, he sent her his dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gail died just before the first false light of dawn touched the sky.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Golden: A Retelling of &#34;Rapunzel&#34; (Once upon a Time)</h2><p>"Once upon a Time" <br> <br> Is Timeless <br> <br> Before Rapunzel's birth, her mother made a dangerous deal with the sorceress Melisande: If she could not love newborn Rapunzel just as she appeared, she would surrender the child to Melisande.

The notion stirs up sentiments of love, admiration, and hatred. We see ourselves in them, and yet we criticize them at times with indignation. While most monarchies today have been put aside or at least limited in their power, the concept of royalty cannot be erased from human consciousness. In the words of Jesus, Christians pray, &#x201c;Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&#x201d; The ultimate and most perfect monarchy is that of God himself, the sovereign of all creation. Through David and the story of the kingship, God taught us about his governance of the world and of his people. David was only human and at times the worthy subject of both praise and severe criticism. But in his relationship with God, we find a model for the people both then and today: suppleness to God&#x2019;s will; wholehearted pursuit of righteousness; sincere repentance from sin; mercy for others; and true worship of God, who alone is worthy.</p><p></p><h2>Paper Son: One Man's Story (Asian American History &amp; Cultu)</h2><p>In this memoir, Tung Pok Chin casts light on the largely hidden experience of those Chinese who emigrated to the USA with false documents during the Exclusion era. Many of the so-called Paper Sons lived out their lives in silent fear of discovery.</p><p>A rare, first person account of an experience shared by thousands of Chinese."This rare, engaging, and often poignant firsthand chronicle of Chin's efforts to create a life for himself in the US while supporting his family in China effectively demonstrates how the continual fear of being exposed as a "paper son" and the changing social, international, and political developments from the 1930s through the 1950s fundamentally shaped Chin's opportunities and experiences. ...this clearly written and accessible autobiography constitutes a rich resource for faculty and students interested in US social history and immigration as well as Asian American studies, and is highly recommended for libraries developing comprehensive Asian American studies collection, or diversifying their collections in US social history, immigration, and labor." &#x2014;Choice</p><h2>Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism</h2><p>If God does not exist, then what does? Is there good and evil, and should we care? How do we know what's true anyway? And can we make any sense of this universe, or our own lives? <i>Sense and Goodness without God</i> answers all these questions in lavish detail, without complex jargon. A complete worldview is presented and defended, covering every subject from knowledge to art, from metaphysics to morality, from theology to politics. Topics include free will, the nature of the universe, the meaning of life, and much more, arguing from scientific evidence that there is only a physical, natural world without gods or spirits, but that we can still live a life of love, meaning, and joy.<br><br>Dr. Carrier is an established historian and philosopher and former editor-in-chief of the Secular Web, and he draws on his extensive experience for over ten years defending the worldview of naturalism as well as his formal studies in the history of science, religion and philosophy. Most notable is Carrier's extensive defense of universal moral truth without appealing to supernatural objects or beings, his articulation of leading multiverse theories and why they are simpler and more plausible explanations of our universe than any divine creationism, his summary of the case for mind-brain physicalism, his broad and innovative defense of compatibilist free will, his discussion of the scientific study of beauty, and a philosophical defense of sometimes unorthodox political views. Although it is written for a lay audience, <i>Sense and Goodness </i>tackles the sophisticated attacks on naturalism by the likes of Plantinga, Moreland, Reppert, and others. In the process he presents a complete worldview-in-a-box for easy evaluation, and explains why it is more credible than any other.</p><p>Dr. Richard Carrier is a philosopher and historian with a Ph.D. in ancient history from Columbia University. His work in history and philosophy has been published in <i>Biology &amp; Philosophy</i>, <i>The History Teacher</i>, <i>German Studies Review</i>, <i>The Skeptical Inquirer</i>, <i>Philo</i>, the <i>Encyclopedia of the Ancient World</i> and more. He also contributed critically acclaimed chapters to the books <i>The Empty Tomb</i> and <i>The Christian Delusion</i>.

In the time of space shuttles and the Strategic Defense Initiative, outer space is the only place equality seems possible, even as the stars serve to both guide and obscure the earthly complexities of masculinity and migration. In Matejka's poems, hope is the link between the convoluted realities of being poor and the inspiring possibilities of transcendence and escape&#x2014;whether it comes from&nbsp;<i>Star Trek</i>, the dream of being one of the first black astronauts, or Sun Ra's cosmic jazz.</p><p>Adrian Matejka is the author of three collections of poetry:&nbsp;<i>The Devil's Garden&nbsp;</i>(2002),&nbsp;<i>Mixology</i>&nbsp;(2009), which was a winner of the National Poetry Series competition, and&nbsp;<i>The Big Smoke</i>&nbsp;(2013), which won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Matejka is the recipient of fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Lannan Foundation, and United States Artists. He lives in Bloomington, Indiana with his wife and daughter.&#x201c;Matejka offers a fresh set of figures for describing the youth of Black Americans now entering middle age. . .There is truly an astounding wealth of material here, cultural artifacts that add up to an ironclad allegory for the plight of urban African Americans in the &#x2018;80s, which serves to point the way to where we are now.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2013; <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Map to the Stars</i> unpacks human systems like race, poverty and parenting.

For a rocket-powered poet like Adrian Matejka, where else to aim but the stars?&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><b>--Campbell McGrath<br></b><br>&#x201c;Matejka&#x2019;s fourth book is a coming-of-age collage set in Reagan-era Indianapolis, a series of intimate verbal snapshots of African American youth and family life. The speaker of these poems is caught between lonesome artifacts of the past . . . and hopeful, strange, and complicated glimpses of possible futures . . . Matejka swirls these seemingly disparate parts into a stunningly coherent vision of life in the 1980s, growing up poor and black and full of energy and longing.&#x201d; <b><br>&#x2013; Craig Morgan Teicher, npr.org<br></b><br> &#x201c;In his stellar fourth collection, Matejka evokes an Indianapolis boyhood in which economic and educational privations starkly contrast with the inspiring expanses of outer space . . .

This award-winning story is the basis for the musical <i>Violet,</i> which won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. In "Hitchhiker," a wary secretary hitches a ride in a boat with a man hell-bent on saving fish; instead he saves her from the river -- and herself.

Black Bob McKraw&#x2014;terror of the Wild West&#x2014;and his posse don't take too kindly to pirates invading their town. And to add insult to injury, the pirates and cowboys can't understand a lick of what the others are saying. None of them cowboys speak Pirate, and none of them pirates speak Cowboy.

His fun, whimsical illustrations have been used in children's books, advertising, magazines, and even the side of a bus. He lives in sunny California.Linguistic jargon gets plenty of play as the titular pirates and cowboys face off in this fanciful picture book that embraces the popular premise of mixing up oddball characters (think Jon Scieszka&#x2019;s Cowboy and Octopus, 2007, and Patricia Storms&#x2019; The Pirate and the Penguin, 2009). A sea-creature-staffed pirate crew discovers they need a new place to bury treasure, having used up their seaside real estate. They lumber inland all the way to Cheyenne. Alas, the western town is run by a passel of outlaw cowboys (farm animals, mostly), and trouble begins when neither group understands the other. &#x201c;Me hearties&#x201d; armed with cutlasses and looking for &#x201c;fair scrub and a swish&#x201d; are countered by rootin&#x2019;-tootin&#x2019; gunslingers who demand the pirates &#x201c;head for the hills.&#x201d; Only Pegleg Highnoon, &#x201c;the world&#x2019;s only pirate cowboy,&#x201d; can avert the danger. Barneda&#x2019;s beady-eyed acrylics are rendered in the dusty tones of the plains, while generous white space places emphasis upon the text.

Countess Ashby de la Zouche and her maid, the faithful Alpiew, are dashing around, plying their trade as scandal-mongers. Happily, scandals are falling in their laps like ripe plums. But scandal takes on some gravitas when the Countess and Alpiew are hired to solve the murder of a popular leading lady. And things get yet more serious when they stumble into a mess of corruption with connections to the very furthest reaches of society.</p></p><p><p>Fidelis Morgan is an actor and an expert in Restoration comedy. Acclaimed for her stage plays, <em>Pamela</em> and <em>Hangover Square,</em> she also collaborated with Lynda la Plante on England's Channel 4's tense pschological thriller <em>Killer Net.</em> She has written nonfiction studies of charismatic female figures from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and contributed to the bestselling Virago anthology <em>Wicked.</em> In her first novel, <em>Unnatural Fire,</em> she combined historical interest with her life-long passion for crime fiction.</p>In her second bawdy, madcap adventure (after 2001's Unnatural Fire), the incomparable Anastasia, Lady Ashby de la Zouche, Countess of Clapham, Baroness Penge (and former mistress to Charles II), aided by her faithful maid, Alpiew, faces "a brace of murders, an illicit marriage ceremony, an escape of a prisoner from the Tower, bribery, corruption at the highest level, a burglary and an abduction." When she doesn't run fast enough, bailiffs temporarily deposit the Countess in a "sponging house" for debtors. At other times such blackguards as Lord Giles Rakewell and his hooligans, the Tityre-tus gang, harass her. Morgan, a British actress and expert on Restoration comedy, brings 1700 London intensely to life, from the filth-ridden Thames to teeming Covent Garden, home to pickpockets, actors and writers. The Countess and Alpiew eke out a livelihood writing gossip for the London Trumpet, as well as planting "puff," or publicity. A lot of the fun derives from walk-ons by real people, such as the actor and playwright Colley Cibber, famous in his day for "improving upon the work of a barbarous Elizabethan third-rater named Shakespeare." Living nearby is an incorrigible old lecher who gives the Countess his memoirs. She figures it may prop a table-surely no one will ever read Samuel Pepys. Restoration England will never be the same after this romp.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820&#x2013;1875</h2><p><p>This is not your grandfather&#x2019;s history of Texas. Portraying nineteenth-century Texas as a cauldron of racist violence, Gary Clayton Anderson shows that the ethnic warfare dominating the Texas frontier can best be described as ethnic cleansing.</p> <p><em>The Conquest of Texas</em> is the story of the struggle between Anglos and Indians for land. Anderson tells how Scotch-Irish settlers clashed with farming tribes and then challenged the Comanches and Kiowas for their hunting grounds. Next, the decade-long conflict with Mexico merged with war against Indians. For fifty years Texas remained in a virtual state of war.</p> <p>Piercing the very heart of Lone Star mythology, Anderson tells how the Texas government encouraged the Texas Rangers to annihilate Indian villages, including women and children. This policy of terror succeeded: by the 1870s, Indians had been driven from central and western Texas.</p> <p>By confronting head-on the romanticized version of Texas history that made heroes out of Houston, Lamar, and Baylor, Anderson helps us understand that the history of the Lone Star state is darker and more complex than the mythmakers allowed.</p></p><p><b>Gary Clayton Anderson,</b> Professor of History at the University of Oklahoma, is author of <i>The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820&#x2013;1875</i>.

The next section focuses on keeping God at the center of worship.

In Decolonization and the Decolonized, Memmi expands his intellectual engagement with the subject and examines the manifold causes of the failure of decolonization efforts throughout the world.As outspoken and controversial as ever, Memmi initiates a much-needed discussion of the ex-colonized and refuses to idealize those who are too often painted as hapless victims. He shows how, in light of a radically changed world, it would be problematic&#x2014;and even irresponsible&#x2014;to continue to deploy concepts that were useful and valid during the period of anticolonial struggle.Decolonization and the Decolonized contributes to the most current debates on Islamophobia in France, the &#x201c;new&#x201d; anti-Semitism, and the unrelenting poverty gripping the African continent. Memmi, who is Jewish, was born and raised in Tunis, and focuses primarily on what he calls the Arab-Muslim condition, while also incorporating comparisons with South America, Asia, Black Africa, and the United States. In Decolonization and the Decolonized, Memmi has written that rare book&#x2014;a manifesto informed by intellect and animated by passion&#x2014;that will propel public analysis of the most urgent global issues to a new level.Albert Memmi is professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Paris, Nanterre, and the author of Racism (Minnesota, 1997).Robert Bononno, a teacher and translator, lives in New York City.</p><p>Albert Memmi was born in Tunis in 1920.

But fewer know that Hitler's fateful transition from ambitious demagogue to Europe's most vicious tyrant occurred on an ordinary Saturday--June 30, 1934--in a little-known event that would come to be called "The Night of the Long Knives." This is the story of the events leading up to that awful event, and its most horrifying repercussions.<br></p><p>Many wonder how an entire nation could allow Adolf Hitler&#x2015;a mediocre army corporal and failed landscape painter&#x2015;to become the architect of the most calamitous events of the twentieth century. But few know that Hitler's fateful transition from ambitious demagogue to Europe's most vicious tyrant occurred on an ordinary Saturday&#x2015;June 30, 1934&#x2015;through a little-known event that would come to be called &#x201c;The Night of the Long Knives.&#x201d; In The Night of the Long Knives, Paul R. Maracin has painstakingly pieced together the scattered and intentionally obscured elements of this fascinating story of deceit, intrigue, and mass murder that has as yet received little attention from historians. First came the burning of the Reichstag&#x2015;Germany's parliament&#x2015;an event that Hitler's government blamed on subversives. Hermann G�ring appeared on the scene with an arrest list containing the names and addresses of every &#x201c;enemy of the state,&#x201d; a list that Hitler and his cronies had been preparing for months. Hitler himself arrested the principal victim at Bad Wiessee when he burst into the hotel room of Ernst R�hm, revolver in hand. R�hm was the head of the brownshirts&#x2015;the Nazis' three-million-member private army&#x2015;and thus one of Hitler's most dangerous rivals in the Nazi party.

One is the legendary Temple of Sheba, an ancient world as fantastic as King Solomon&#x2019;s mines. The other is a band of Nazi soldiers who plan to turn the sacred landmark into Hitler&#x2019;s secret stronghold. Kane&#x2019;s discovery could change the course of the war&#x2014;but what he knows just might&nbsp;get him killed first.</p><p><b>Jack Higgins</b>&nbsp;lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands. The author of dozens of bestsellers, most famously&nbsp;<i>The Eagle Has Landed</i>, he served three years with the Royal Horse Guards in Eastern Europe during the Cold War, and subsequently was a circus roustabout, a factory worker, a truck driver, and a laborer before entering college at age 27. He holds degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics, and a doctorate in media. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, he is an expert scuba diver and marksman.In this slick archeological thriller, Higgins (The Eagle Has Landed) reaffirms his skill as a storyteller. In 1939, with the world on the brink of war, American Arabist Gavin Kane is hired to find a missing husband. The missing husband, John Cunningham, disappeared while on a wild goose chase through the Middle East in search of the legendary Temple of Sheba. The Temple turns out to be all too real. And, unfortunately for Kane and his friends, the Nazi's have discovered the Temple first and are using it as headquarters to implement Hitler's plan to destroy the Suez Canal. The mixture of archeology and Nazism, naturally brings to mind Indiana Jones and, in fact, the book is very reminiscent of those movies. This is the kind of story where all the villains have German accents, and the heroes can survive a 30-mile hike in the desert with no water. Who cares if the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes (the dashing archeologist, the mysterious beautiful woman)? This fast-paced story has enough action and adventure to make up for any such shortcomings. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Mark of Zorro (Townsend Library Edition)</h2><p>This Townsend Library classic has been carefully edited to be more accessible to today&#39;s students.

Acclaimed by educators nationwide, the Townsend Library is helping millions of young adults discover the pleasure and power of reading.</p><p><p>Pulp-fiction author Johnston McCulley (1883&#x2013;1958) began his writing career with magazine short stories, later moving on to novels and screenplays. His subjects ranged from crime thrillers to action heroes of Southern California, most notably Zorro, whose exploits have been repeatedly adapted for movies and television.</p><b><i>Chapter 1</i></b> <br> <b>&nbsp;</b> <br> <b>Pedro, the Boaster</b> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Again the sheet of rain beat against the roof of red Spanish tile, and the wind shrieked like a soul in torment, and smoke puffed from the big fireplace as the sparks were showered over the hard dirt floor. <br>"'Tis a night for evil deeds!" declared Sergeant Pedro Gonzales, stretching his great feet in their loose boots toward the roaring fire and grasping the hilt of his sword in one hand and a mug filled with thin wine in the other. "Devils howl in the wind and demons are in the raindrops! 'Tis an evil night, indeed--eh, <i>se�or</i>?" <br>"It is!" the fat landlord agreed hastily; and he made haste, also, to fill the wine mug again, for Sergeant Pedro Gonzales had a temper that was terrible when aroused, as it always was when wine was not forthcoming. <br>"An evil night!" the big sergeant repeated, and drained the mug without stopping to draw breath, a feat that had attracted considerable attention in its time and had gained the sergeant a certain amount of notoriety up and down El Camino Real, as they called the highway that connected the missions in one long chain. <br>Gonzales sprawled closer to the fire, and cared not that other men thus were robbed of some of its warmth. Sergeant Pedro Gonzales often had expressed his belief that a man should look out for his own comfort before considering others; and being of great size and strength, and having much skill with the blade, he found few who had the courage to declare that they believed otherwise. <br>Outside, the wind shrieked and the rain dashed against the ground in a solid sheet. It was a typical February storm for southern California. At the missions the <i>frailes</i> had cared for the stock and had closed the buildings for the night. At every great <i>hacienda</i> big fires were burning in the houses. The timid natives kept to their little adobe huts, glad for shelter. <br>And here in the little <i>pueblo</i> of Reina de Los Angeles, where, in years to come, a great city would grow, the tavern on one side of the plaza housed for the time being men who would sprawl before the fire until the dawn rather than face the beating rain. <br>Sergeant Pedro Gonzales, by virtue of his rank and size, hogged the fireplace, and a corporal and three soldiers from the <i>presidio</i> sat at table a little in back of him, drinking their thin wine and playing at cards. An Indian servant crouched on his heels in one corner, no neophyte who had accepted the religion of the <i>frailes</i>, but a gentile and renegade. <br>For this was in the day of the decadence of the missions, and there was little peace between the robed Franciscans who followed in the footsteps of the sainted Junipero Serra, who had founded the first mission at San Diego de Alc�la, and thus made possible an empire, and those who followed the politicians and had high places in the army. The men who drank wine in the tavern at Reina de Los Angeles had no wish for a spying neophyte about them. <br>Just now conversation had died out, a fact that annoyed the fat landlord and caused him some fear; for Sergeant Pedro Gonzales in an argument was Sergeant Gonzales at peace; and unless he could talk, the big soldier might feel moved to action and start a brawl. <br>Twice before, Gonzales had done so, to the great damage of furniture and men's faces; and the landlord had appealed to the <i>comandante</i> of the <i>presidio</i>, Captain Ram�n, only to be informed that the captain had an abundance of troubles of his own, and that running an inn was not one of them. <br>So the landlord regarded Gonzales warily, and edged closer to the long table, and spoke in an attempt to start a general conversation and so avert trouble. <br>"They are saying in the <i>pueblo</i>," he announced, "that this Se�or Zorro is abroad again." <br>His words had an effect that was both unexpected and terrible to witness. Sergeant Pedro Gonzales hurled his half-filled wine mug to the hard dirt floor, straightened suddenly on the bench, and crashed a ponderous fist down upon the table, causing wine mugs and cards and coins to scatter in all directions. <br>The corporal and the three soldiers retreated a few feet in sudden fright, and the red face of the landlord blanched; the native sitting in the corner started to creep toward the door, having determined that he preferred the storm outside to the big sergeant's anger. <br>"Se�or Zorro, eh?" Gonzales cried in a terrible voice. "Is it my fate always to hear that name? Se�or Zorro, eh? Mr. Fox, in other words! He imagines, I take it, that he is as cunning as one. By the saints, he raises as much stench!" <br>Gonzales gulped, turned to face them squarely, and continued his tirade. <br>"He runs up and down the length of El Camino Real like a goat of the high hills! He wears a mask, and he flashes a pretty blade, they tell me. He uses the point of it to carve his hated letter 'Z' on the cheek of his foe! Ha! The Mark of Zorro they are calling it! A pretty blade he has, in truth! But I cannot swear as to the blade--I never have seen it. He will not do me the honor of letting me see it! Se�or Zorro's depredations never occur in the vicinity of Sergeant Pedro Gonzales! Perhaps this Se�or Zorro can tell us the reason for that? Ha!" <br>He glared at the men before him, drew back his upper lip, and let the ends of his great black mustache bristle. <br>"They are calling him the Curse of Capistrano now," the fat landlord observed, stooping to pick up the wine mug and cards and hoping to filch a coin in the process. <br>"Curse of the entire highway and the whole mission chain!" Sergeant Gonzales roared. "A cutthroat, he is! A thief! Ha! A common fellow presuming to get him a reputation for bravery because he robs a <i>hacienda</i> or so and frightens a few women and natives! Se�or Zorro, eh? Here is one fox it gives me pleasure to hunt! Curse of Capistrano, eh? I know I have led an evil life, but I only ask of the saints one thing now--that they forgive me my sins long enough to grant me the boon of standing face-to-face with this pretty highwayman!" <br>"There is a reward--" the landlord began. <br>"You snatch the very words from my lips!" Sergeant Gonzales protested. "There is a pretty reward for the fellow's capture, offered by his excellency the governor. And what good fortune has come to my blade? I am away on duty at San Juan Capistrano, and the fellow makes his play at Santa Barbara. I am at Reina de Los Angeles, and he takes a fat purse at San Luis Rey. I dine at San Gabriel, let us say, and he robs at San Diego de Alc�la! A pest, he is! Once I meet him--" <br>Sergeant Gonzales choked on his wrath and reached for the wine mug, which the landlord had filled again and placed at his elbow. He gulped down the contents. <br>"Well, he never has visited us here," the landlord said with a sigh of thanksgiving. <br>"Good reason, fat one! Ample reason! We have a <i>presidio</i> here and a few soldiers. He rides far from any <i>presidio</i>, does this pretty Se�or Zorro! He is like a fleeting sunbeam, I grant him that--and with about as much real courage!" <br>Sergeant Gonzales relaxed on the bench again, and the landlord gave him a glance that was full of relief, and began to hope that there would be no breakage of mugs and furniture and men's faces this rainy night. <br>"Yet this Se�or Zorro must rest at times--he must eat and sleep," the landlord said. "It is certain that he must have some place for hiding and recuperation. Some fine day the soldiers will trail him to his den." <br>"Ha!" Gonzales replied. "Of course the man has to eat and sleep! And what is it that he claims now? He says that he is no real thief, by the saints! He is but punishing those who mistreat the men of the missions, he says. Friend of the oppressed, eh? He left a placard at Santa Barbara recently stating as much, did he not? Ha! And what may be the reply to that? The <i>frailes</i> of the missions are shielding him, hiding him, giving him his meat and drink! Shake down a robed <i>fray</i> and you'll find some trace of this pretty highwayman's whereabouts, else I am a lazy civilian!" <br>"I have no doubt that you speak the truth," the landlord replied. "I put it not past the <i>frailes</i> to do such a thing. But may this Se�or Zorro never visit us here!" <br>"And why not, fat one?" Sergeant Gonzales cried in a voice of thunder. "Am I not here? Have I not a blade at my side? Are you an owl, and is this daylight that you cannot see as far as the end of your puny, crooked nose? By the saints--" <br>"I mean," said the landlord quickly and with some alarm, "that I have no wish to be robbed." <br>"To be--robbed of what, fat one? Of a jug of weak wine and a meal? Have you riches, fool? Ha! Let the fellow come! Let this bold and cunning Se�or Zorro but enter that door and step before us! Let him make a bow, as they say he does, and let his eyes twinkle through his mask! Let me but face the fellow for an instant--and I claim the generous reward offered by his excellency!" <br>"He perhaps is afraid to venture so near the <i>presidio</i>," the landlord said. <br>"More wine!" Gonzales howled. "More wine, fat one, and place it to my account! When I have earned the reward, you shall be paid in full. I promise it on my word as a soldier! Ha! Were this brave and cunning Se�or Zorro, this Curse of Capistrano, but to make entrance at that door now--" The door suddenly was opened! <br>&nbsp; <br>All new material copyright � 1998 by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc.</p><h2>The Lincoln Assassination Encyclopedia</h2><p><p>&#x201c;In this encyclopedia of Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination, Edward Steers, Jr., the foremost scholar of the assassination, has assembled knowledge of the subject scattered in documents and writings over a period of nearly a century and a half, organized it authoritatively and comprehensively, and written about it clearly.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;William Hanchett, author of <em>Out of the Wilderness: The Life of Abraham Lincoln</em> </p><p>The definitive A-to-Z reference to the Abraham Lincoln assassination by Edward Steers, author of <em>Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</em>.

The introduction provides a concise overview of the events leading to the assassination and ends with the execution of four of the conspirators. An &#x201c;Assassination Chronology,&#x201d; beginning in 1860 and ending July 25, 1865, provides a time line of events. The entries are arranged in alphabetical order and range in length from a paragraph (for example, Corey, John) to more than eight pages (Booth escape route). Numerous black-and-white photographs, maps, cartoons, and portraits illustrate the articles. All the major and minor players are included, from Booth&#x2019;s family members to &#x201c;Peanut John&#x201d; Burroughs, who held Booth&#x2019;s horse when he went into the theater. Steers also addresses all of the conspiracy theories, such as the claim that John Wilkes Booth escaped and lived under the alias David E. George. He also debunks the theory that Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was behind the assassination and presents evidence pointing to Dr. Samuel Mudd&#x2019;s connection with Booth. Each entry ends with the source of information and in many cases see references to related entries. This in-depth encyclopedia will be a valuable addition to all library collections where information on Lincoln and the Civil War is in demand. It is an appropriate purchase for public and college libraries. --Abbie Landry</p><h2>Selected Poems and Letters (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The poems and letters of one of France's most unusual modern poets, here in both French and English</b><br><br>Arthur Rimbaud was one of the wildest, most uncompromising poets of his age, although his brief literary career was over by the time he was twenty-one when he embarked on a new life as a trader in Africa. This edition brings together his extraordinary poetry and more than a hundred of his letters, most of them written after he had abandoned literature. A master of French verse forms, the young Rimbaud set out to transform his art, and language itself, by a systematic &#x201c;disordering of all the senses,&#x201d; often with the aid of alcohol and drugs. The result is a highly innovative, modern body of work, obscene and lyrical by turns&#x2014;a rigorous journey to extremes.<p>Jeremy Harding and John Sturrock&#x2019;s new translation includes Rimbaud&#x2019;s greatest verse, as well as his record of youthful torment, <i>A Season in Hell</i> (1873), and more than 100 letters that unveil the man who turned his back on poetry. The French text of the poems appears on pages facing the English translations, and John Sturrock's introduction examines Rimbaud's two very different careers.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Louis Althusser, the French Marxist philosopher, maintained that Marx&#x2019;s project could only be revived if its scientific and revolutionary novelty was thoroughly divested of all traces of humanism, idealism, Hegelianism and historicism. In order to complete this critical rereading, Althusser and his students at the �cole normale sup�rieure ran a seminar on <i>Capital</i>, re-examining its arguments, strengths and weaknesses in detail, and it was out of those discussions that this book was born.<br><br> Previously only available in English in highly abridged form, this edition, appearing fifty years after its original publication in France, restores chapters by Roger Establet, Pierre Macherey and Jacques Ranci�re. It includes a major new introduction by �tienne Balibar.</p><p><b>Louis Althusser</b> (1918&#x2013;90) taught philosophy for many years at the �cole normale sup�rieur in Paris.

Yet despite his pre-eminence among the great thinkers of history, little of his life story is known. What we know tends to begin in his middle age and end with his trial and death. Our conception of Socrates has relied upon Plato and Xenophon--men who met him when he was in his fifties, a well-known figure in war-torn Athens.</p><p>There is mystery at the heart of Socrates's story: what turned the young Socrates into a philosopher? What drove him to pursue with such persistence, at the cost of social acceptance and ultimately his life, a whole new way of thinking about the meaning of existence?</p><p> In this revisionist biography, classicist Armand D'Angour draws on neglected sources to explore the passions and motivations of young Socrates, showing how love transformed him into the philosopher he was to become. What emerges is the figure of Socrates as never previously portrayed: a heroic warrior, an athletic wrestler and dancer--and a passionate lover. <i>Socrates in Love</i> sheds new light on the formative journey of the philosopher, finally revealing the identity of the woman who Socrates claimed inspired him to develop ideas that have captivated thinkers for 2,500 years.</p></p><p>Armand D'Angour is an Associate Professor of Classics at Oxford and Fellow and Tutor at Jesus College, Oxford. Author of <i>The Greeks and the New </i>(2011), an investigation into ancient Greek attitudes to novelty, he has written widely about Greek and Latin poetry, music and literature, and was commissioned to compose odes in ancient Greek for the Olympic Games in Athens (2004) and London (2012). He was trained as a pianist and cellist as well as a classicist, and has recently reconstructed ancient Greek music from original documents on stone and papyrus.<p>"It is a tour de force of scholarship, and [D&#x2019;Angour] sifts through his vast reading with judicious care. Open-minded but not credulous, he accomplishes what was long thought to be impossible: a reliable, consistent account of the man who forged the matrix of Western philosophy." - <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Brings to life classical personages of the ancient world for a new audience. . . . Other interpretations of this life exist but few will serve as well as a first introduction to Socrates." - <i>New York Journal of Books</i></p><p>"Sympathetic and irreverent ...

Socrates is one of the very few philosophers whose thoughts on love are worth reading" - <i>Daily Telegraph</i></p><p>"In this brilliant study, Armand D&#x2019;Angour refocuses the works of Socrates the Philosopher by looking afresh at the life of Socrates the Man. In doing so, he provides new insights not just into Socrates but into ancient Greek thinking as a whole" - <i>Peter Frankopan, author of 'The Silk Roads'</i></p><p>"Write the name Aspasia on your hearts!

D&#x2019;Angour guesses that the majority of people who know something about him will answer that Socrates was &#x2018;a thinker, wise man, or philosopher of ancient Greece.&#x2019; If your answer was along these lines, then you need to pick up this book ... Not only clearly well-researched, but it is also enjoyable to read" - <i>All About History</i></p><p>"A book that succeeds brilliantly in achieving something that I had always assumed was impossible: providing a historically grounded portrait of the man Socrates may actually have been. Not merely eye-opening, it is thrilling and moving" - <i>Tom Holland</i></p><p>"Armand D&#x2019;Angour&#x2019;s new readings of Plato&#x2019;s dialogues bring a new Athenian world to life ...

His beautiful new girl Friday, Annie Dugan, is far more interested in fieldwork than filing, and despite Ric&#x2019;s best efforts to ignore the attraction, sparks are flying between them. Then one of Ric&#x2019;s clients turns femme fatale and tries to gun down an innocent man. Thanks to quick thinking and even quicker reflexes, Ric comes to the rescue, only to learn he&#x2019;s done a very good deed for some very bad people. <br><br> Suddenly Ric finds himself deep undercover with Annie, working for notorious crime boss Gordon Burns. One mistake from Ric&#x2019;s painfully inexperienced partner and they&#x2019; re both dead.<br><br> FBI agent Jules Cassidy&#x2019;s life isn&#x2019;t in much better shape.

Still, he could tell that she was tempted.<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he tried reason. &#x201c;I said you could ride along. There&#x2019;s an unspoken understanding there that you&#x2019;ll stay in the car.&#x201d; Of course, they were both already out of the car, standing in this suckhole of a parking lot on the crap side of Sarasota.<br><br>At least they were standing in the shade.<br><br>Annie, too, tried reason. But hers was laced with attitude. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go in. And unless Hutch is on his way over . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Damn, but he hated when she called him Starsky, even by omission like that. But this time he clenched his teeth and kept his mouth shut. This was definitely not the time or place to get into The Argument, which went something like: &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s right, Ric, you don&#x2019;t have a Hutch. You don&#x2019;t want one, don&#x2019;t need one, even though I&#x2019;m standing right here, volunteering for the job. No, you prefer to believe&#x2014; despite years of police work that proved otherwise&#x2014;that you don&#x2019;t need any backup whatsoever. You&#x2019;d prefer to end up lying in an alley again, with the shit kicked out of you. You&#x2019;d prefer to pee blood. Again.&#x201d;<br><br>Annie&#x2019;s second day of work as his new office assistant at Alvarado Private Investigations hadn&#x2019;t been a particularly good day for Ric.<br><br>Her third day, however, had included his successful apprehension and delivery to the FBI of the shitkicker&#x2019;s brother, who was wanted in four states for a variety of violent crimes. Ric had received a twenty-thousand-dollar reward for his diligent, but not particularly brilliant detective work. Twenty thousand. After adding up the time he&#x2019;d put in, plus expenses, it worked out to just over four hundred dollars an hour, which was sweet. Well, sweet, with the exception of those particularly nasty twenty minutes during which he&#x2019;d allowed himself to get stomped in order to gain possession of the kicker&#x2019;s cell phone&#x2014;which subsequently revealed the location of his even nastier older brother&#x2019;s girlfriend. And again, it wasn&#x2019;t Ric&#x2019;s skill as a detective, but rather the fact that Nasty the elder had just broken the woman&#x2019;s nose, that had worked to Ric&#x2019;s advantage. For a slim five percent share of the reward, plus a truckload of revenge, she&#x2019;d eagerly divulged the wanted man&#x2019;s whereabouts.<br><br>Still, four hundred dollars an hour, however he&#x2019;d earned it, wasn&#x2019;t something to sneeze at. And the fact that he&#x2019;d finally worked a lucrative case that didn&#x2019;t involve bored, wealthy suburbanites cheating on each other was another reason to cheer.<br><br>Yet it was the getting-beaten-up-and-peeing-blood part that Annie brought up over and over again.<br><br>Along with the fact that she had been sorely misled by her own asshole-of-a-brother-Bruce&#x2014;her name for him, not his&#x2014;to believe that Ric needed an assistant rather than a receptionist. Annie had taken this position, she&#x2019;d told him, not merely because she needed a job where she could bring along her separation-anxiety-suffering little rat-dog, but because she didn&#x2019;t want to sit behind a desk all day. Yet all Ric wanted her to do was sit in his office behind a desk, take phone calls, and create&#x2014;again, her words&#x2014;stupid office forms.<br><br>Of course, the most recent stupid office form Annie had created&#x2014;in under ten minutes&#x2014;was an exceptionally well-organized client interview sheet. It was precisely what he&#x2019;d needed&#x2014;possibly with the exception of those two little boxes, one that said yes, one that said no, next to the words This client wants to do me.<br><br>He&#x2019;d used her interview sheet with his current client, an extremely well-put-together older woman named Lillian Lavelle, who&#x2019;d come to his office just this morning.<br><br>As Ric now watched, Annie got ready to go inside of Screech&#x2019;s, the so- called gentleman&#x2019;s club where a young dancer named Brenda Quinn had last been employed. They had been hired&#x2014;he had been hired&#x2014;to find Brenda, who was Ms. Lavelle&#x2019;s recently deceased daughter&#x2019;s former roommate. Ms. Lavelle apparently had a photo album that she wanted to give to the young woman.<br><br>The entire case was proving to be slightly more difficult than he&#x2019;d first imagined. He&#x2019;d taken it just this morning, expecting to be filing it in the &#x201c;case closed&#x201d; drawer long before noon.<br><br>It was now sunset, pink and orange clouds streaking the western sky, as a cooling breeze blew in off the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>As Ric watched, Annie took off her jacket, tossed it in the back of her car, and ran her fingers through her light brown curls.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he won&#x2019;t recognize me,&#x201d; Ric said as she fished in her shoulder bag for something.<br><br>He deserved the look of scorn that she shot him, because it was a stupid thing to say. There was zero chance in hell that Screech&#x2019;s bouncer, Tommy Fista, wouldn&#x2019;t recognize him. Seven years ago, almost to this very day, Ric had jammed his knee into the middle of Tommy&#x2019;s gargantuan back as he&#x2019;d cuffed him and read him his Miranda rights. Fista had gone to Raiford Maximum Security for five to seven for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.<br><br>Ric tried again. &#x201c;I heard he found God in jail.&#x201d;<br><br>As he watched, Annie glanced around the corner at the bouncer. Clearly Fista hadn&#x2019;t found Jenny Craig in the lockup. The huge man was standing at the door to Screech&#x2019;s, which was a fairly new establishment, having opened since Ric had left the police department last year.<br><br>Still, it hadn&#x2019;t taken Ric much effort to learn that it was owned and operated by Vitardo Co. Strip clubs in this part of Florida were usually owned either by local scumbag Gordon Burns or his main rival, Miami-based Bernie Vitardo.<br><br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the best-case scenario?&#x201d; Annie asked as she applied lip gloss with one finger, leaning down to see herself in her little car&#x2019;s side mirror. &#x201c;Tony-the-bouncer takes you by the hand, leads you inside for a joyful hymn and prayer session before sharing&#x2014;willingly&#x2014; everything he knows about Brenda Quinn?&#x201d; She straightened up, smacking her lips together as she put the container back in her bag.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Tommy the bouncer,&#x201d; Ric corrected her. This was possibly the first time he&#x2019;d ever seen Annie with makeup on, and he searched his memory, trying to prove himself wrong. But no. Aside from Halloween back when she was little, he couldn&#x2019;t think of a single time that she&#x2019;d gotten dressed up. She hadn&#x2019;t gone to her school prom. And she&#x2019;d worn one of Bruce&#x2019;s suits and ties to her high school graduation. Although, as far as makeup went, what she had on now wasn&#x2019;t much. It just made her full lips look shiny. More moist.<br><br>If that was possible.<br><br>Annie Dugan wasn&#x2019;t traditionally pretty, at least not in a helpless- and-fragile delicate female sense. She did, however, have the fresh- faced, Irish American peasant-girl thing down pat, with big gray eyes and freckles, naturally curly hair, and a wide smile that could, at times, be incredibly sweet.<br><br>Her attitude, however, was pure twenty-first-century kick-ass dominatrix.<br><br>With the exception, perhaps, of her attachment to her ridiculous little dog, Pierre. Ric would&#x2019;ve expected a woman like Annie to have a golden Lab. Something large and outdoorsy, capable of playing ultimate Frisbee in the park. Something that galloped. Something friendly named Pal or Lucky.<br><br>Not this glorified fuzzball of a quivering rodent named Pierre, that she now hugged and kissed and gave a doggy treat to, all while reassuring it that she&#x2019;d be right back.<br><br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the worst-case scenario here?&#x201d; she asked, plopping the rat- thing back onto the front seat of her car, making sure his travel bowl of water was full before turning her attention back to Ric. &#x201c;A trip to the dentist with your two front teeth on ice in a Ziploc baggie? Or maybe another few days of pink urine? Gee, that&#x2019;s always so much fun. Setting my watch alarm to go off every ten minutes so I can check to make sure you haven&#x2019;t gone into shock from excessive hemorrhaging . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>Yeah, telling her about the internal-injury thing had definitely been a mistake. At the time Ric had thought it would invoke a little sympathy, maybe make her extend the two-week notice that she&#x2019;d given him back when she&#x2019;d quit&#x2014;on day one of her employment&#x2014;when she found out she&#x2019;d be sitting behind a desk.<br><br>Time was running out. He had only a few days left to replace her or convince her to stay.<br><br>And it was there that she had the unfair advantage.<br><br>He wanted her to stay. Rather badly.<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t days, it was day,&#x201d; he pointed out now.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going in to find Brenda Quinn&#x2019;s last known address,&#x201d; Annie told him with that hint of bitch-queen, do-not-cross-me, I-am-determined, you-are-toast that he&#x2019;d first heard in her voice back when he&#x2019;d met her, when she was eleven and he was fifteen. Almost twenty years ago. Damn, had they really been friends for nearly two decades? Although he hadn&#x2019;t seen very much of her in the last ten years . . .<br><br>Still, it occurred to him that now, just as when she was little, the best way to deal with her might be simply to let her try. Just hang close to pick her up and dust her off in case she failed miserably.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t as if there were any real danger hiding in that strip club.<br><br>It was, however, filled with relentless apathy, seedy despair, and unending depression. Spending some time in Screech&#x2019;s might well make Annie decide against a career path as a private investigator.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Ric said.<br><br>She looked up at him with a mix of wariness and disbelief.<br><br>Ric nodded. &#x201c;Go for it. Go find Brenda.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think I can do this,&#x201d; she accused him.<br><br>&#x201c;What does it matter what I think?&#x201d; he countered. &#x201c;It only matters what you do. Or don&#x2019;t do.&#x201d; Which was more likely going to be the case. But she&#x2019;d find that out soon enough.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Yoda.&#x201d; She gave a tug on the bottom of her T-shirt, as if that would somehow provide the illusion that she had real breasts.<br><br>And thank you, Mary Mother of God, for keeping him from saying that aloud, because he definitely hadn&#x2019;t meant to be insulting, just realistic. Not that her breasts weren&#x2019;t real. They just weren&#x2019;t stripper-sized.<br><br>They were extremely nice, actually. And now that he was thinking about it, it was really her waist that wasn&#x2019;t stripper size, which was good, because women who had that creepy, tiny-waisted wasp thing going on just didn&#x2019;t do it for him. No, Annie was curvy and soft in a way that Ric truly appreciated. She was no skinny twig who might snap if you held her too tightly and he was so screwed because he was standing here, staring at her body, thinking about sex.<br><br>And that was a serious violation of rules one through about two thousand and twenty-seven in the male employer/female employee relationship handbook. It came right before rule number two thousand and twenty-eight: Never, never, never employ family or friends&#x2014; because how the hell do you go from twenty years of friendship to employment without completely screwing things up?<br><br>Cursing Annie&#x2019;s brother, Bruce, and his brilliant ideas&#x2014;Bruce who was going to be mad as hell when he found out that Ric had actually let Annie go into that strip club, so he better never find out&#x2014;Ric looked slightly more northward, and found himself meeting Annie&#x2019;s gray gaze.<br><br>Her very cool gray gaze.<br><br>It was disconcerting as hell. If she wore heels, she&#x2019;d be at least as tall as he was, and he was not a short man.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a jerk,&#x201d; she said, clearly able to read his mind all the way back to his real-breasts thought. &#x201c;What, do you think I&#x2019;m going to pretend I&#x2019;m here to apply for a job as an exotic dancer?&#x201d;<br><br>Well, yeah, that was what he&#x2019;d thought. But sometimes it was best to keep one&#x2019;s mouth firmly shut.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stupid, Alvarado,&#x201d; Annie continued. &#x201c;Nor am I deluded. I know what I look like.&#x201d; She laughed her disbelief. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;d pay to see me strip?&#x201d;<br><br>With that, she turned and walked away, across the parking lot, around the edge of the building that kept Ric out of Tommy&#x2019;s line of sight, toward Screech&#x2019;s front entrance.<br><br>Pierre stood up in the front seat of Annie&#x2019;s car, paws on the steering wheel so that he could watch her go.<br><br>Ric watched her, too&#x2014;watched her T-shirt stretching across her back as she moved. Bruce had told him that one of her last jobs, after she quit the accounting firm, was assisting a woman who built stone walls. She was clearly strong and very . . . healthy. Very. With those long denim-clad legs leading up to a posterior that was . . . definitely healthy.<br><br>And in a flash, he could picture her, in motorcycle leather, sexy as hell, with seven-inch platform heels that would turn her into a total Amazon, strutting the stage with a whip, hooking her leg around a pole as she writhed to the pulsating music.<br><br>God save him.<br><br>She was out of sight now, and he peeked around the corner, far less patient than Pierre, who&#x2019;d settled in for a nap as he waited for Annie&#x2019;s promised return.<br><br>Across the parking lot, she&#x2019;d stopped to speak to Tommy Fista, who not only let her pass, but actually held the door for her. When Tommy&#x2019;s head was turned, she sent a quick grin and a thumbs-up in Ric&#x2019;s direction, before vanishing into the club.<br><br>Max Bhagat, the head of the FBI&#x2019;s most elite counterterrorist division, had a huge stain on his tie.<br><br>He was standing in the waiting area just outside of the Oval Office, and as Jules Cassidy approached this man who was both his boss and his friend, he saw that it was Emma-goo that marred the fine blue silk. It looked as if it might be oatmeal, with traces of Max&#x2019;s one- year-old daughter&#x2019;s favorite, mashed sweet potatoes.<br><br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the file, sir.&#x201d; Jules handed the sealed envelope over. &#x201c;The news is bad.&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t say more than that out here, but he didn&#x2019;t need to.<br><br>Max knew what they were dealing with. This was just confirmation. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said, sticking the envelope into his briefcase.<br><br>The man had also missed a spot while shaving&#x2014;a small patch near his left ear. No one else would notice it&#x2014;at least those who didn&#x2019;t know Max as the meticulously, obsessively well-groomed person that he was.<br><br>To Jules, who&#x2019;d worked with him for years, he looked practically slovenly.</p><h2>At the Foot of the Cross with Julian of Norwich</h2><p>This book seeks to bring to a popular readership a devotional engagement with Julian&#39;s work.

The story of the Stone Age is our story, and primitive technology is a way for anyone who wants to understand that shared history. Watts makes the case that the learning and practice of aboriginal skills helps us connect with our remote past, encourages us to participate in the shared inheritance of primitive ('first') skills. <br> Practicing Primitive includes detailed instructions on how to make or perform over 65 Stone Age objects or skills, covering primitive basics such as making axes and food utensils out of stone, bone, shell, and plant material; bark and reed shelters; bags and ropes made of bark and leaves; watercraft out of reeds or bamboo; and much more. Watts covers the environment, lifestyle, and tool kit of three different stages of human evolution: the Lower Paleolithic of 2.5 million years ago, the Middle Paleolithic of 60 thousand years ago, and the Mesolithic 9 thousand years ago. <br> Steven M.

The Ming dynasty, almost 300 years old, lurches to a bloody end. Peking falls to the Manchus, the emperor hangs himself, and Ming loyalists take refuge in the southern capital of Nanking. Two valiant generals seek to defend the city, but nothing can overcome the corruption, decadence, and factionalism of the court in exile. The newly installed emperor cares for nothing but theater, leaving practical matters to the insidious Ma Shih-ying. Ma&#x2019;s crony Juan Ta-ch&#x2019;eng is as unscrupulous an operator as he is sophisticated a poet. He diverts resources from the starving troops in order to stage a spectacular production of his latest play. History, however, has little time for make-believe, though the earnest members of the Revival Club, centered on the handsome young scholar Hou Fang-y� and his lover Fragrant Princess, struggle to discover a happy ending.</p><p><b>K'ung Shang-jen</b> (1646&#x2013;1718) was a sixty-fourth generation descendant of Confucius and was raised in his ancestor&#x2019;s hometown of Qufu in Shandong province. A noted expert in music and Confucian rites, he was chosen in 1684 to lecture to the visiting emperor Kangxi, who later appointed him to the Imperial Academy in Beijing. <i>The Peach Blossom Fan</i> was completed in 1699 and was performed to great acclaim in 1700. It was not published, however, until 1708, a few years after K&#x2019;ung had left his post and returned home to Qufu.<br><br><b>Judith T. Zeitlin</b> is the William R.

Among his books are <i>The Genesis of Poetic Time</i> and, with Harold Acton, <i>Modern Chinese Poetry</i>.<br><b><br>Harold Acton</b> (1904&#x2013;1994) was a prolific Anglo-Italian writer, poet, novelist, and translator. He lived in China from 1932 to &#x2019;39, teaching English literature at the University of Peking.<br><b><br>Cyril Birch</b> is a translator and the Agassiz Professor of Chinese and Comparative Literature emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;<i>The Peach Blossom Fan</i> is replete with romance, conflicts between loyalty and treachery, a healthy measure of bawdy humor, punning, elegant poetry, moral issues, and popular philosophical currents....This is a lively, readable, and faithful translation of a major work of Chinese literature.&#x201d; &#x2014;Howard Goldblatt<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Many popular Chinese plays fail to qualify as literature, being no more than plain scripts for brilliant actors to display their virtuosity. <i>The Peach Blossom Fan </i>appears to be a luminous exception, for it is a highly poetic chronicle play composed by a distinguished scholar, K&#x2019;ung Shang-jen, who was born soon after the events he portrayed. As a vivid evocation of the downfall of the Ming dynasty, it deserves to be better known to students of Chinese literature and history.&#x201d; &#x2014;Harold Acton</p><h2>Queen Victoria&#39;s Book of Spells: An Anthology of Gaslamp Fantasy</h2><p><p>"Gaslamp Fantasy," or historical fantasy set in a magical version of the nineteenth century, has long been popular with readers and writers alike. A number of wonderful fantasy novels owe their inspiration to works by nineteenth-century writers ranging from Jane Austen, the Bront�s, and George Meredith to Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, and William Morris. And, of course, the entire steampunk genre and subculture owes more than a little to literature inspired by this period.</p><p><i>Queen Victoria's Book of Spells </i>is an anthology for everyone who loves these works of neo-Victorian fiction, and wishes to explore the wide variety of ways that modern fantasists are using nineteenth-century settings, characters, and themes. These approaches stretch from steampunk fiction to the Austen-and-Trollope inspired works that some critics call Fantasy of Manners, all of which fit under the larger umbrella of Gaslamp Fantasy. The result is eighteen stories by experts from the fantasy, horror, mainstream, and young adult fields, including both bestselling writers and exciting new talents such as Elizabeth Bear, James Blaylock, Jeffrey Ford, Ellen Kushner, Tanith Lee, Gregory Maguire, Delia Sherman, and Catherynne M. Valente, who present a bewitching vision of a nineteenth century invested (or cursed!) with magic. <br>A <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>Best Fiction Book of 2013</p></p><p><p>Multiple award-winning editor ELLEN DATLOW has been editing science fiction, fantasy, and horror short fiction for almost thirty years.

She lives in Virginia with her family and is having a blast writing the Down South Caf� Mysteries.Chapter 1<br><br> I was working on breakfast prep when my cousin Jackie popped her head into the kitchen and said, "Amy, Stu Landon is here."<br><br> "Great. Thanks." I removed my plastic gloves and then went outside to greet the beekeeper.<br><br> Mr. Landon and I had just entered into an arrangement wherein I'd sell his honey on consignment to my patrons. I own and operate the Down South Caf�, one of Winter Garden, Virginia's only two restaurants.<br><br> It was a gorgeous August morning, and Mr. Landon, a tall, thin man with salt-and-pepper hair, was shading his eyes with his hand when I stepped out into the sunlight.<br><br> "Did you want me to bring the honey in through the back of the caf� or the front?"<br><br> "Just bring it into the dining room and put it on the counter, please," I said. "I've already cleared some shelf space on the back wall, and I plan to keep a jar by the register so people will be sure to notice it."<br><br> Mr. Landon opened the passenger side door of his olive green antique Chevy pickup truck and got out a small plastic crate containing half-pint jars of honey. I held open the door to the caf� for him and then followed him inside.<br><br> He placed the crate on the counter in front of the cash register. "This all right?"<br><br> "Perfect." I plucked one of the jars out of the crate. Landon's Bee Farm, Pure All Natural Honey. "I want to buy a couple of jars from you straight out to serve to my diners and one to take home to my mom and Aunt Bess."<br><br> I went around the counter, opened the register, and paid Mr. Landon for three jars of honey. I put a note in the register reflecting the transaction and then gave the consignment agreement I'd prepared the night before to Mr. Landon. I still had seven jars left to sell to Down South Caf�&nbsp;customers.<br><br> "Thank you, Ms. Flowers. I'll come around next week to bring you ten more jars." He took a dilapidated cap from the back pocket of his overalls, shook it out, and placed it on his head before leaving.<br><br> I turned to my cousin Jackie with a smile. "That one is a man of few words."<br><br> "Granny says he used to be some sort of secret agent."<br><br> Jackie's granny was my great-aunt Elizabeth, known to Mom and me as Aunt Bess. And since Aunt Bess is blessed with a vivid imagination, I wouldn't normally have given her theory on Mr. Landon more than a passing thought. But unlike most of the residents of Winter Garden, Mr. Landon didn't have much of a history here. He'd simply shown up one day about twenty years ago and taken up residence on the old Carver farm. He'd renovated the farm, started growing his own vegetables, and set up beehives. Since he kept to himself and wasn't very talkative, that's about all folks knew about him. Other than the fact that his honey was really tasty and that Mr. Landon swore that the stuff was good for everything from curing allergies to treating wounds. I didn't know how valid his claims were, but I did know that the honey tasted awfully good on a warm biscuit.<br><br> "Why in the world would Aunt Bess think Stu Landon was a secret agent?" I asked Jackie. "And what could the man have possibly been investigating in Winter Garden?"<br><br> She shrugged. "You'll have to take that up with Granny, but I believe she's under the impression that Winter Garden was merely his base of operations."<br><br> Dilly Boyd, one of our favorite caf� regulars, came through the door. She was a tiny lady with cottony hair and mischievous blue eyes. She wore a wide-brimmed sun hat that she swept off her head as she joined us at the counter.<br><br> "What have you got there?" She peered into the crate. "Ooh, Landon's honey. I'd like a jar, please."<br><br> "All right. I'll keep it here by the register for you and you can pick it up on your way out."<br><br> "Okay. When did you start selling Landon's honey?"<br><br> "Just this morning. It's our first batch, so to speak," I said with a smile. "I'm hoping to get even more of our local farmers to offer some of their crops on consignment."<br><br> "Maybe you should host a farmer's market here on Saturday mornings," Dilly said. "That'd be fun."<br><br> "That's not a bad idea, Dilly. I'll look into it."<br><br> "Before we get completely off track, though," said Jackie, "what do you know about Stu Landon, Dilly?"<br><br> She frowned. "What do you mean?"<br><br> "We were just saying that we've known Mr. Landon all our lives, but we don't know much about him," I said.<br><br> "Well, he came here . . . oh, I reckon it was nearly twenty years ago now . . . from somewhere out West. Moved here alone and didn't go out of his way to socialize, other than with the Carvers, who live to the right of his place. That stands to reason, though, since he bought a farm from some of the Carvers. Some folks think they might be kin." She drew her thin, pale eyebrows together. "I always figured somebody had broken Stu's heart and that he came here to hide himself away. Some of us tried to fix him up with daughters or nieces or widows, but he wouldn't have any part of that nonsense, so we finally left him alone." She wandered over to her favorite seat at the counter.<br><br> "Scrambled eggs and biscuits?" I asked.<br><br> She nodded. "And some hash browns would be nice too."<br><br> "Coming right up." I went into the kitchen. "Jackie, would you mind shelving the honey, please? And leave a jar for Mom and Aunt Bess under the counter."<br><br> "No problem," she said. "Dilly, how's that raccoon of yours doing?"<br><br> Dilly didn't actually own a raccoon, but one came to visit her and get a biscuit every evening.<br><br> "He's as right as rain and as punctual as a clockmaker," she said. "He comes to my back door at sundown every single day."<br><br> "Wonder if he'd like some honey on his biscuit?" I called from the kitchen.<br><br> "I don't know whether he would or not. But if he thinks I'm wasting my good honey on him, the little beggar's mistaken."<br><br> We had a little lull in business just before ten that morning, and I was able to grab a cup of coffee and look around the caf� for a couple of minutes. I always try to remember to acknowledge my blessings every day, and the Down South Caf&#x17d; was certainly a big one.<br><br> When I'd bought the caf� from Pete Holman, it had been a dive. I don't know how else to put it. The place was dingy-the floor was linoleum that should have been replaced twenty years prior, the fixtures were old and tarnished, and most of the stools and dining room chairs had tears. Thanks to my childhood friend-and Jackie's boyfriend-Roger, who had his own construction company, the floors were now gleaming and scuff-resistant bamboo, the walls were a cheerful yellow with blue trim, and we had new gray stools and dining room furniture, new light fixtures, and a patio for patrons to enjoy when the weather cooperated. We also had a refrigerated display case for pies, cakes, cookies, potato salad-whatever we thought our diners might want to take home with them. And we had a bakers' rack with shelves of jams, Down South Caf� T-shirts and aprons (blue with yellow lettering), and now Mr. Landon's honey.<br><br> Homer Pickens came in at ten o'clock, punctual as ever. He was always at the caf� at ten and always ordered a sausage biscuit. An eccentric, Homer chose a new hero every day.<br><br> "Morning, Homer!" I called from the kitchen. I'd finished my coffee and was preparing vegetables for the coming lunch rush.<br><br> "Hi, Amy. How are you this morning?"<br><br> "I'm good." I covered the bowl of lettuce I'd been shredding and went to speak with Homer properly. "Mr. Landon brought some honey this morning. We're selling it on consignment in addition to serving it to customers and using it in recipes. Would you like some?"<br><br> "No, thanks. I'm not a big fan of honey. I liked it when I was a little boy, but then one of my friends told me honey was bee puke. I never touched the stuff again after that."<br><br> "Some friend." I glanced around to make sure none of the other diners had heard his remark. If anyone had, it hadn't seemed to put them off their breakfast. "So who's your hero today?"<br><br> "Joseph Joubert, the essayist. Joubert once said, 'When you go in search of honey, you must expect to be stung by bees.' Appropriate for this morning, huh?"<br><br> "It sure is." I often wondered if Homer had a photographic memory. He was always at the ready with a quote from one of his heroes, and it often applied to the subject at hand. He'd grown up poor and had dropped out of school in the tenth grade to go to work. I wondered how far he might've gone had he been given the opportunity.<br><br> "What do you know about Mr. Landon?" I asked. "We were talking about him this morning, and we realized we don't know much about him except that he's a loner with a mysterious past."<br><br> "If being a loner makes a man mysterious, then I must be an enigma myself." He took a sip of the coffee Jackie put in front of him. "After Mother died, I was completely alone. It had always been just the two of us. Of course, I dated now and then, but I never let myself get involved in a serious relationship."<br><br> "Why's that?" That behavior didn't sound like the warm, generous Homer I knew.<br><br> "I never wanted to marry and have children. What if I'd turned out to be like my father? He just ran out on us. I wouldn't have wanted that for any woman or child."<br><br> I was trying to think of something encouraging to say when Homer reminded me that he was awfully set in his ways. I took that as my cue to stop yammering and get him that sausage biscuit.<br><br> By the time I closed the caf� that afternoon, I had only three jars of Mr. Landon's honey left, besides the one I'd bought for Mom and Aunt Bess. I decided to go by the farm to see if I could get more. The honey had sold better than Mr. Landon and I had anticipated.<br><br> Landon's Bee Farm was only about a twenty-minute drive from Winter Garden. It wasn't as hot as it had been-especially for August-so I drove with the windows down instead of using the air-conditioning. It dawned on me that if my yellow Beetle had more black on it, I'd resemble a giant bumblebee as I buzzed down the country road to see the beekeeper.<br><br> To get to the farm, I had to turn off the main road and climb a steep, deeply rutted dirt road. That's when I put up the windows and turned on the air. I didn't want a face full of dust.<br><br> No wonder Mr. Landon didn't get many visitors-this road was a nightmare. I drove as slowly as I could without losing the momentum to get up the hill, and I just hoped I didn't damage my car in the process.<br><br> When I finally parked near Mr. Landon's small brick house, I stooped down to make sure there were no fluids leaking from the undercarriage of the car. Fortunately, there weren't, but I made a mental note to check again-and to check my tires-before I left. I wondered how Mr. Landon's antique pickup truck survived the trek every day, but then I realized it was much higher off the ground than my little Bug.<br><br> I smoothed my hair back from my face and stepped onto the porch. I rang the bell, but Mr. Landon didn't answer the door. I went to see if he might be in the backyard.<br><br> Mr. Landon was striding toward the house with his veiled bee hat in his hand. He was still about a hundred yards away from me, but I could see that he was angry. I was beginning to regret dropping in unannounced; and if the man hadn't already seen me, I'd have been sorely tempted to leave.<br><br> When he was close enough, I called out, "Hi, Mr. Landon. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time!" That seemed like a stupid thing to say since he was obviously upset, but I hoped that when I told him how well his honey was selling at the caf�, it might lift his spirits.<br><br> "What can I do for you, Ms. Flowers?" He went into a shed still a few yards away from where I was standing.<br><br> I eased forward but steered clear of the shed. I didn't want to crowd his space more than I already was. "I just came to let you know that we almost sold out of your honey today. I wondered if you might be able to spare a few more jars before next week."<br><br> Mr. Landon emerged from the shed without the veiled hat and wiped the sweat from his brow with a blue bandanna. "I'll need to put it into jars and drop it off tomorrow morning. Will ten more work?"<br><br> "Yes, that'll be great. Thank you."<br><br> We stood in awkward silence for a moment, and I was getting ready to say good-bye when Mr. Landon spoke.<br><br> "I was hoping to have quite a bit more honey by fall, but I won't if Chad Thomas has his way about it."<br><br> "What do you mean?"<br><br> "I just came from checking the hives," he said. "And you know what I found? Hundreds of dead bees."<br><br> I gasped. "That's terrible! And you believe this Mr. Thomas killed them?"<br><br> "I know he did. He wantonly sprays his crops whenever he takes a notion without regard for the safety of my bees." He shook his head. "Most of the farmers around here understand our mutual need to protect pollinators. They know I close the bees up at night and keep them there until noon. If I left them inside any later than that, the sun would cook them."<br><br> "How awful."<br><br> "Well, that's not going to happen, Ms. Flowers, because I take care of my bees. And most of my neighbors spray when the bees are closed inside their hives. But Chad-" He gave a low growl of disgust. "He's a different story. He sprays whenever he feels like it, and today one of my hives suffered for his flagrant disregard."<br><br> "Isn't there some sort of law in place to protect the bees? Aren't they an endangered species?"</p><h2>Farthing: A Story of a World that Could Have Been (Small Change, 1)</h2><p><p>First published in 2006, Jo Walton's <i>Farthing</i> was hailed as a masterpiece, a darkly romantic thriller set in an alternate postwar England sliding into fascism.</p><p>Eight years after they overthrew Churchill and led Britain into a separate peace with Hitler, the upper-crust families of the "Farthing set" are gathered for a weekend retreat. Among them is estranged Farthing scion Lucy Kahn, who can't understand why her and her husband David's presence was so forcefully requested. Then the country-house idyll is interrupted when the eminent Sir James Thirkie is found murdered&#x2015;with a yellow Star of David pinned to his chest.</p><p>Lucy begins to realize that her Jewish husband is about to be framed for the crime&#x2015;an outcome that would be convenient for altogether too many of the various political machinations underway in Parliament in the coming week. But whoever's behind the murder, and the frame-up, didn't reckon on the principal investigator from Scotland Yard being a man with very private reasons for sympathizing with outcasts and underdogs&#x2015;and prone to look beyond the obvious as a result.</p><p>As the trap slowly shuts on Lucy and David, they begin to see a way out&#x2015;a way fraught with peril in a darkening world.</p></p><p>Praise for "Farthing" <br>"If Le Carre scares you, try Jo Walton. Of course her brilliant story of a democracy selling itself out to fascism sixty years ago is just a mystery, just a thriller, just a fantasy--of course we know nothing like that could happen now. Don't we?"<br>--Ursula K. Le Guin <br>"It really is one of those books that succeeds in almost too many ways to count. It's a great, engaging read, and sharp as a knife. The most meaningful parahistorical novel I've come across in a long time, succinct and rivetingly readable."<br>--Robert Charles Wilson <br>""Farthing" starts out as a cozy period house party mystery, becomes a brilliant alternate history yarn, and at last reveals itself to be a chilling political thriller. It's smart, riveting, and deeply moving. Once you start reading, don't plan to put it down."<br>--Emma Bull <br>"A wonderful book, simultaneously a gripping mystery and a harrowing cautionary tale. Walton's credible--and entirely convincing--alternative history becomes a terrifying meditation on class, power, and persecution."<br>--Susan Palwick<p>JO WALTON won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer on the publication of her debut novel, <i>The King's Peace</i>. Her novel <i>Tooth and Claw</i> won the World Fantasy Award, and the novels of her Small Change sequence<i>&#x2015;Farthing,</i> <i>Ha'Penny</i>, and <i>Half a Crown</i>&#x2015;have won acclaim ranging from national newspapers to the Romantic Times Critics' Choice Award.

She followed a clean diet. She worked out at the gym regularly. But no matter what she did, she could not get her body to let go of those last fifteen pounds she wanted to lose to feel healthy again. She&#x2019;d been successful at reducing her weight in the past. But this time, no luck.</p><p>When Leslie came to my office and shared her current program with me, I was struck by all the work she&#x2019;d done to lose weight. There really weren&#x2019;t any additional diet- or exercise-related changes she could make--she&#x2019;d been that disciplined. She was even aware that working out too hard or eating too little could stimulate counterproductive stress hormones, so she&#x2019;d also been focused on striking a healthy balance between the two and on reducing stress in other areas of her life.</p><p>Leslie had done everything that I would have recommended, with the exception of one critical ingredient for success: She had not yet started to meditate.&nbsp;</p><p>When I suggested she begin meditation, she was skeptical but game. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted to try meditation,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even if I don&#x2019;t lose weight, maybe this program will help me stick with it.&#x201d;</p><p>Leslie started with five minutes a day, working up to ten minutes once she felt ready. Initially, she struggled to find the time in her busy schedule, but then she quickly came to see meditation as a highlight of her day. And sure enough, shortly after coming to see me--making no other changes to her self-care routine--Leslie had lost fifteen pounds. I continued to see her once or twice a year for a few years, and she has maintained that loss, seemingly effortlessly--looking more serene (and younger!) each time I see her.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve watched many men and women spend a tremendous amount of time perfecting their diet and exercise regimes--really pushing themselves toward clean diets, yoga, high-performance athletics, and more--but remaining frustrated and unhappy with their results. Some struggle with consistency, battling inner demons they can&#x2019;t seem to defeat, and get pulled back into self-sabotaging habits. Others, like Leslie, can motivate themselves to do all the right things, but they still don&#x2019;t see the changes they want, and they don&#x2019;t feel their best. Patients often come to me in tears, wondering what else they could possibly do to break through this frustrating plateau. Many have done everything possible to tell their bodies that they want to be at a different weight. But just like Leslie, they need to make the final, critical connection: They need to relay that message to their minds.&nbsp;</p><p>Leslie was still operating with outdated ideas about herself. In her mind she was an overweight woman. She hadn&#x2019;t yet started to visualize herself at her target weight--and her fixed image of herself ensured that her body would hold on to those fifteen pounds, no matter what. Her brain--the master of her nervous system, the captain of the whole body--needed to believe the change was possible in order to allow the biochemical changes necessary to make it happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Meditation changed her perspective and helped her have faith in her image of herself as lean and vital. Her daily meditation practice and the resulting mental shift was all it took for her body to let go of those last fifteen pounds.</p><p>Whether I&#x2019;m working with stressed-out college students or hard-charging executives, new moms or recent retirees, I have seen that meditation can be a very simple but transformative solution to all manner of stubborn and frustrating problems. In our quest for more vibrant health and happiness, many of us are held back by subconscious messages and long-standing patterns. We might not even know our blocks exist, even as we run headlong into them, day after day. But as little as five minutes of mindful meditation, practiced daily, can help us become aware of our blocks--which is often the first and most important step to getting past them.</p><p>As meditation helps you see your blocks, you begin to understand the connection between the hidden messages you&#x2019;re sending to yourself, the self-defeating patterns you unconsciously follow, and the frustrating lack of progress you&#x2019;ve made toward your goals. But rather than nudging you into a self-chastising spiral, meditation helps you develop greater understanding of and compassion for yourself, foibles and all. It is in this space of peace and self-compassion that your body relaxes its defenses, opens up, and reveals its innate instinct for health--often enabling natural, automatic, even effortless weight loss.&nbsp;</p><p>As we make meditation a regular part of our daily lives, we experience small &#x201c;aha!&#x201d; moments that progress to ever-richer insights. These changes start to compound as we become stronger and less engaged with our fears. We develop the courage to turn and face the biggest problems in our lives, painful issues we may have avoided facing for years--issues that often turn out to be the very root causes of some of our most frustrating blocks.</p><p>These foundational shifts may take a while to occur, but once we address them, life suddenly seems easier, richer, more meaningful. We begin to heal lifelong injuries, reboot long-dormant dreams, and set off on paths that had previously seemed inaccessible.&nbsp;</p><p>And all of this begins with just a few minutes a day. When you tap the power of meditation, your quest to remove extra pounds is often just the beginning of a truly life-changing transformation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple but Mighty</p><p>The practice of meditation is actually very simple: You require nothing but an intention to quiet your mind for a few moments. You don&#x2019;t need any equipment or extensive training--you don&#x2019;t even necessarily need a quiet space (although it is handy). As simple as meditation is, its powerful effects have been studied and validated by the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. Millions of people have been subjected to sleep studies, blood tests, brain scans, and all manner of clinical trials to chronicle its effects on our various body systems. This research has proven that meditation has a verifiable, physical effect on how our bodies manage stress; it changes our physiology, our nervous and endocrine systems, even the very structure of our brains.&nbsp;</p><p>Meditation can support almost any effort to improve health--including the pursuit of a healthy weight. In fact, a recent analysis of peer-reviewed studies that looked at mindfulness-based interventions to address eating behaviors related to weight gain--including overeating, binge eating, and emotional eating--found that participants in 86 percent of the mindfulness studies demonstrated improvement in their weight-related goals.1</p><p>Research shows that meditation, and especially mindfulness meditation, aids weight loss efforts in the following ways:</p><p>by teaching us to slow down and truly savor our food, so we enjoy it more and need less to feel satisfied</p><p>by helping us understand what actual physical hunger and fullness feel like, instead of eating out of habit or craving</p><p>by helping us question those cravings that seem &#x201c;irresistible&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many studies have shown that mindfulness techniques can reduce food cravings and enhance weight loss. But more awareness can also help us clearly see how our mental habits affect us: Why do we crave certain foods, whether healthy or unhealthy? Why do we have self-limiting mental patterns--and how do those patterns impact our body image, our health, our posture? How do we treat ourselves--and how do we interact with and treat others? How do we feel and live and breathe and move in our lives? All of these questions play a role in our health and our happiness, our level of connection with others and contentment with our lives. If we can start to get at the answers to those questions, the weight loss often comes naturally.</p><p>Seem too good to be true? How can simply sitting quietly have that much impact? Maybe you have your doubts about meditation--or you&#x2019;ve tried it, but it doesn&#x2019;t seem to work for you. Let&#x2019;s look at a few of the most common myths about meditation to see if we can address those doubts and reservations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some Myths About Meditation--and the Truth</p><p>Though meditating is simpler to do than many believe, it is also a mysterious process--how does it work, exactly? Even scientists are not exactly sure, but they&#x2019;re getting closer. That mystery sometimes causes a bit of a PR problem for meditation, but I&#x2019;d love to clear up a few of those misunderstandings.</p><p>Myth: &#x201c;Meditation is a spiritual practice.&#x201d;</p><p>Truth: Meditation is, first and foremost, a mental practice.</p><p>Meditation is not voodoo. Meditation is not New Age or mystical. Yes, meditation has been used in many forms in religious traditions and cultures throughout history and throughout the world--but the act of meditating isn&#x2019;t inherently spiritual.</p><p>At its core, meditation is a means of training your mind. It has direct physiological effects on the brain and nervous system that can be studied in the lab, tracked by sophisticated fMRI brain scanners, or analyzed with a blood test, stethoscope, or heart rate monitor. In fact, over the last twenty-five years, more than three thousand studies on meditators have been conducted at some of the most respected research institutions in the world, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and the universities of California, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, among many others. The data from these studies is very clear: Meditation helps people lead healthier, happier, and more fulfilling lives.</p><p>Myth: &#x201c;Meditation just doesn&#x2019;t work for me.&#x201d; Or: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t meditate.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>Truth: Meditation works for everyone, and everyone can do it.</p><p>I hear it all the time: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t meditate--it just doesn&#x2019;t work for me.&#x201d;</p><p>Imagine if a baby who was just learning how to walk tried to take a step and fell down, then turned around and said, &#x201c;Sorry, Mom and Dad--this walking thing just doesn&#x2019;t work for me.&#x201d;</p><p>Silly, right? But meditation is like walking--it&#x2019;s an activity we learn to do in very short spurts, then continue to practice and improve upon for the rest of our lives.</p><p>Once you&#x2019;ve mastered the basics of walking, you can go in any direction you&#x2019;d like--you can run the fifty-yard dash in gym class, you can train for a 5k, you can become a marathoner. Or, like many people, you might just stick with basic walking to get you through your days. But the core mechanics involved in each of these activities is exactly the same: You put one foot in front of the other, and you move forward.</p><p>Meditation is just like that. You might just do three minutes a day; you might work up to twenty. You might fall in love with it and decide to dig deep and do a retreat. But at an elemental level, no matter where you find yourself currently, you are a meditator. From the very first moment you sit, take a breath, and notice that your mind is wandering, you&#x2019;re already doing it--you&#x2019;re meditating.</p><p>Myth: &#x201c;The real type of meditation is [X]--and if you don&#x2019;t do [X], you&#x2019;re not really meditating.&#x201d;</p><p>Truth: Any type of meditation is &#x201c;real&#x201d;; no one type is better than another.</p><p>When we start meditating, a common trap is to get caught in thinking we have to follow a specific type of meditation. When I first got into meditation back in the early nineties, people were very specific about it. I heard all kinds of dictums:</p><p>You can&#x2019;t be sitting on a chair--you have to sit on a cushion.</p><p>Your legs need to be in this position.</p><p>You have to have your right thumb on top and your left thumb on the bottom.</p><p>Your right heel must be in front.&nbsp;</p><p>Your spine has to be right over your pelvis.&nbsp;</p><p>You have to chant this or think about that.</p><p>All of these might be helpful suggestions to you--or not. To use meditation to reach your health goals, there are truly no absolutes of this kind. What works for you is what works for you. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you do a visualization, or count your breaths, or simply take a moment to close your eyes and be still while riding on the bus--all of these are just tools, and all of them are forms of meditation. Anytime you take a moment to just sit there--voila, you&#x2019;re meditating.&nbsp;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s the ultimate goal of meditation: that, with practice, you will get to a level of comfort in which you can just tip back into that same relaxed, focused mental space on the drop of a dime, anytime you notice that you&#x2019;re getting stressed. By developing your meditation skills, you become able to step out of the stress loop and remain cool, calm, and collected as often as you&#x2019;d like.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re drawn to one specific method of meditation, that&#x2019;s great--stick with what works for you. Find the tool that you need and use it. But from a scientific perspective, and for the results we&#x2019;re looking for in the mind and body, please know there are many &#x201c;right&#x201d; ways to do it.</p><p>Myth: &#x201c;You have to meditate for twenty minutes or more, or it&#x2019;s not worth it.&#x201d;</p><p>Truth: Any amount of meditation can make a difference in your life.</p><p>The length of time you spend meditating is absolutely secondary to frequency. If you have to struggle and force yourself to stay still for twenty minutes, you&#x2019;re not going to get the health benefits that you would get from simply sitting for five minutes and just paying attention to your breath. The effort you expend to sit in that spot longer than your tolerance can take will stimulate a stress response in your nervous system. I would so much rather you meditate once a day for three minutes than once a week for twenty.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, that little time really does make a difference. One study found that as few as five minutes of meditation a day for four weeks significantly reduced participants&#x2019; measures of stress and anxiety and increased their perceived quality of life.2 Another study found that fifteen minutes of meditation a day reduced participants&#x2019; measures of stress by up to 36 percent.3 But even something as simple as a singular, mindful exhale can lower your blood pressure, at least for a moment or two.</p><p><br>1 G.

It is only by delving into the hidden secrets of life that we can advance not just to moral doctrines but to the moral sources of life, true moral impulses. At different times, humanity has manifested moral life in different ways. <br><br>To understand these differences, the evolution of consciousness must also be taken into account. Originally morality was a part of human nature, for in their essence human beings are good. But through evolution, there have come errors, deviations, times of falling away. In this small, much-loved cycle of three lectures Rudolf Steiner indicates the sources for the recovery of a living morality for our time.<br><br>Rudolf Steiner shows the transformation of the virtues through the evolution of consciousness and, above all, through the incarnation of the Christ in the Mystery of Golgotha. Since then, morality works to build up Christ's being.<br><br> <b>Synopses:</b><br><ol><br><li> Why morality needs to be studied. Preaching morality v. founding morality: examples of ancient India (devotion to wisdom) and ancient Europe (courage). Leprosy in the Middle Ages. The biography of Francis of Assisi; the transformation of courage into love. The reality of moral forces.</li><li> The caste system; differentiation as to a law of evolution. The betrayal of the Atlantean Mysteries; the consequences for the European population. Racial evolution v. soul evolution. The demons of leprosy overcome by the Christ impulse in Francis of Assisi. Francis's prior incarnation; the mysteries at Colchis and the Buddha. Francis's faith in the original goodness of humanity. Plato's four virtues.</li><li> The nature of evil and freedom; the teaching of the mean. Interest as a precondition for understanding and moral conduct. Spiritual Science, as divine wisdom, stimulates interest. During the third post-Atlantean cultural epoch, interest was regulated by the instinctive virtue of "wisdom"; today, interest must be regulated by conscious truthfulness. The lack of truthfulness in modern times; theosophy as an educator of truthfulness. Truthfulness as the virtue of the sentient soul. Courage as the instinctive virtue of the mind soul in the fourth epoch; today, in the fifth epoch, it must become love, based on understanding. This is promoted by a theosophical comprehension of the Christ. Temperance as the virtue of the consciousness soul is still instinctive in the fifth epoch; it will be replaced by "life wisdom" in the sixth epoch. The effect of spiritual-scientific wisdom on the body. The virtue of "justice." Knowledge of the suprasensory world through wonder, astonishment, faith. The evolution of conscience. The Christ impulse is naked; it must be clothed by impulses of wonder, love, conscience. Founding v. preaching morality: the reality of the Christ impulse v. abstract ideals of brotherhood.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>There Before the Chaos (The Farian War, 1)</h2><p><b>The first volume of an epic space opera trilogy featuring the gunrunner empress Hail Bristol, who must navigate alien politics and deadly plots to prevent an interspecies war.</b><br>Hail Bristol: former runaway princeess, interplanetary gunrunner, Empress of Indrana.<br>When the Empire's closest ally asks her to intervene in a galactic military crisis, she embarks on the highest stakes diplomatic mission Indrana has ever faced. <br>Caught between two powerful alien civilizations at each other's throats, Hail has one chance to make peace, before all of humanity becomes collateral damage in a full-blown galactic war.<b><br></b><b><i>There Before the Chaos</i> begins a fresh, pulse-pounding space opera series from an exciting new voice in science fiction.</b><br><br>For more from K.

At the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Imperial Japanese Navy had unleashed a new weapon of desperation, the dreaded kamikaze squadrons, in an effort to stave off defeat. Admiral &#x201c;Bull&#x201d; Halsey, his reputation clouded after controversial decisions at Leyte, grew obsessed with destroying kamikaze air bases in the Philippines. Meanwhile, a tropical storm in the Pacific was slowly gaining power, unseen, untracked, unsuspected.

A critical figure in the history of postwar American culture, Tosh Berman's father, Wallace Berman, was known as the "father of assemblage art," and was the creator of the legendary mail-art publication <em>Semina.</em> Wallace Berman and his wife, famed beauty and artist's muse Shirley Berman, raised Tosh between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and their home life was a heady atmosphere of art, music, and literature, with local and international luminaries regularly passing through.</p><p>Tosh's unconventional childhood and peculiar journey to adulthood features an array of famous characters, from George Herms and Marcel Duchamp, to Michael McClure and William S. Burroughs, to Dennis Hopper and Dean Stockwell, to the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, and Toni Basil.</p><p><em>TOSH</em> takes an unflinching look at the triumphs and tragedies of his unusual upbringing by an artistic genius with all-too-human frailties, against a backdrop that includes <em>The</em> <em>T.A.M.I. Show,</em> <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, <em>Easy Rider</em>, and more. With a preface by actress/writer Amber Tamblyn (daughter of Wallace's friend, actor Russ Tamblyn), <em>TOSH</em> is a self-portrait taken at the crossroads of popular culture and the avant-garde. The index of names included represents a who's who of midcentury American&#x2014;and international&#x2014;culture.</p><p>Praise for <em>Tosh</em>:</p><p>"Tosh Berman's sweet and affecting memoir provides an intimate glimpse of his father, Wallace, and the exciting, seat-of-the-pants LA art scene of the 1960s, and it also speaks to the hearts of current and former lonely teenagers everywhere."--<strong>Luc Sante</strong>, author of <em>The Other Paris</em></p><p>"This is the story of a kid growing up inside of art world history, retelling his upbringing warts and all. A well-written, fast-moving book that is candid, funny, often disturbing, and never dull."--<strong>Gillian McCain</strong>, co-author of <i>Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk</i></p><p>"<em>TOSH</em> is a delightfully entertaining memoir filled with sly wit and a profound personal perspective."--<strong>John Zorn</strong>, composer</p><p>"One could not wish for a better guide into the subterranean and bohemian worlds of the California art/Beat scene than Tosh Berman, only scion of the great Wallace. Tosh has a sly wit and an informed eye, he is both erudite and neurotic, and often hilarious."--<strong>John Taylor, Duran Duran</strong></p><p>"There's the life&#x2014;and then there's <em>the life</em>. With <em>TOSH</em> you can have both. My life, and that of many who sailed with me, was formed by the 40's &amp; 50's. <em>TOSH</em> takes you there."--<strong>Andrew Loog Oldham</strong>, producer/manager, The Rolling Stones</p> <p>"As the son of artist Wallace Berman, Tosh Berman had a front row seat for the beat parade of the '50s, and the hippie extravaganza of the '60s. It was an exotic, star-studded childhood, but having groovy parents doesn't insulate one from the challenge of forging one's own identity in the world. Berman's successful effort to do that provides the heart and soul of this movingly candid chronicle of growing up bohemian."--<strong>Kristine McKenna</strong>, co-author of <em>Room to Dream</em> by David Lynch</p> <p>"This is a beautifully written memoir, and I highly recommend it to those who are interested in the Sixties, Topanga Canyon, the Southern California art scene, and for those who wonder what it might mean to grow up as the son of one of our most acclaimed artists."--<strong>Lisa See</strong>, author of <em>The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane</em></p></p><p><p>Tosh Berman is a writer, poet, and publisher of TamTam Books. As a publisher, he focused on post-war French figures such as Boris Vian, Guy Debord, Serge Gainsbourg and French gangster Jacques Mesrine, as well as publishing Sparks (Ron Mael &amp; Russell Mael) and Lun*na Menoh. His previous book <em>Sparks-Tastic</em> (2013) is a combination of travel journal and thoughts on the band Sparks. His book of poems <em>The Plum in Mr. Blum&#x2019;s Pudding</em> (2014) came out through Penny-Ante Editions. He authored the introduction to <em>Wallace Berman: American Aleph</em> from the Michael Kohn Gallery in 2016.</p><p><strong>Chapter</strong><strong> 1 (Wallace)</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My mother, Shirley Morand, first saw her future husband&#x2014;my father&#x2014;driving a convertible, with a cat wrapped around his neck, somewhere on the streets of Hollywood. Wallace Berman, at that time, never left the house without his cat. The nineteenth-century French writer G�rard de Nerval had a pet lobster named &#x201c;Thibault,&#x201d; and he would take it out for evening walks through Paris, attached to a silk leash. Wallace, in his fashion, was returning to the eminent, artistic, eccentric personalities of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Paris. Without a doubt, he made backward glances to the artists he greatly admired and their peculiar habits. I learned style through both parents, due to their knowledge of such dandies of the past and present, as well as the art and literature that dwell in that world of provocateurs and visionaries. I understood the importance of the past as a reference for the ideal life, and I inherited a passion for artists and poets who didn&#x2019;t belong in the world, who had to invent a landscape in which they could live and do their art. I learned that from Wallace, due to his numerous homages to the artistic set that lived before him.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the time of my mom&#x2019;s first sighting of Wallace with his cat, he cut quite a striking figure that screamed &#x201c;Los Angeles dandy.&#x201d; A man who had an understanding of the criminal street life, he knew that the results of such a life had to be fine clothing, which to him meant zoot suits. It was World War Two, the height of the zoot suit craze, and there was, in fact, a law on the books which forbade the zoot suit, owing to the excess fabric in making the outfit; all surplus material was expected to be sent to the government for the war effort. What could attract a criminal minded youth more than wearing such clothing at the height of war?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My father&#x2019;s family had come from another part of the world. His mother Anna and his grandmother were Russian Jews. They settled in Staten Island, New York, where his father was an owner of a candy store. According to speculation, the store was a front, either for a speakeasy or bootlegging. My grandfather seemed to have too much money just for owning a neighborhood candy store. In the only picture I&#x2019;ve seen of Wallace&#x2019;s father, he&#x2019;s wearing tennis clothes&#x2014;long white pants, tight white shirt&#x2014;with a racket in his hand. My mom also told me that she used to own a photograph of Wallace&#x2019;s mother and father in a large car with a chauffeur. When he died, which I think was from the aftereffects of tuberculosis, he only left two books for Wallace, a collection of tales by Oscar Wilde and T.E. Lawrence&#x2019;s <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em> (1926). After his death, the family, which by then included Anna&#x2019;s brother Harry, relocated to Boyle Heights, Los Angeles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the time, Boyle Heights was a community of Japanese Americans, Latinos, and Jews. Much of the neighborhood&#x2019;s population changed after the 1950s, when the freeways were built. The Berman clan eventually moved to another Jewish neighborhood, in Fairfax, which is very close to Hollywood. Around this time Wallace had a best friend by the name of Sammy Davis, Junior. My grandmother Anna said to me that her heart began to race one morning when she went into Wallace&#x2019;s bedroom and saw Sammy asleep in the bed. At first, she thought Wallace turned black, but he was sleeping by the bedside on the floor, giving Sammy his bed. I remember my dad telling me how he and Sammy went to the Hollywood Palladium on Sunset Boulevard to see Glenn Miller and his big band and weren&#x2019;t allowed to go in because of Sammy&#x2019;s skin color. Wallace never told me how they initially met, but I presume they first laid eyes on each other on Central Avenue, in one of the jazz or dance clubs of the 1940s. They totally lost touch with each other after their teenage years, but right before Wallace died, he saw Sammy at the dentist. Wallace popped his head into the office and said hello. My dad told me that Sammy&#x2014;dental tools still in his mouth&#x2014;nearly perished in the chair. Wallace said a quick &#x201c;Hello, how are you?&#x201d; and then got out of there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During his late teens in the middle of the &#x2019;40s Wallace underwent a series of failures. First, he got kicked out of Fairfax High School for gambling. Then he enlisted and got kicked out of the Navy due to a nervous breakdown. Then he went to Chouinard Art School, and was kicked out of there for reasons unknown. Be they cause or effect of these failures, my father&#x2019;s taste for the outsider&#x2019;s life and distaste for mainstream American life were firmly established. It&#x2019;s been hinted to me that my dad was involved the criminal world as a teenager, though I&#x2019;ve never heard any stories of his actual criminal activity. But he clearly never felt comfortable in the &#x201c;straight&#x201d; world. The nine-to-five schedule wasn&#x2019;t for him. He had no problem with people who preferred that life, but for him, there was another world out there that was so much more attractive, the world that existed in the night. The key to that world was, at first, criminal activity, but that led to his beloved pursuits of jazz, poetry, and the visual arts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Wallace discovered the world of books at the Los Angeles Downtown Library on Fifth Street and Flower. This library was probably where he discovered the poetry of Rimbaud, Baudelaire, and perhaps the early surrealist writers. For sure, he became acquainted with the visual world in the library&#x2019;s art department. At the time, in Los Angeles, there weren&#x2019;t any huge contemporary art collections. So his initial exposure, specifically to art made in the past, came from books. The very first painting that I was conscious of as a child was Henri Fantin-Latour&#x2019;s <em>Coin de Table</em> (1872), a portrait of Verlaine and Rimbaud among other poets of their time. My mom and dad had a print of this painting on the wall in our house in Beverly Glen. I looked at this work, not knowing anything, really, except who Rimbaud was&#x2014;even though, of course, as a child, I never read him. My father taught me his name as soon as I began to form words on my own.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But Wallace also kept an eye on American popular culture. Ever since he was a kid, he had a love for Alex Raymond&#x2019;s comic strip <em>Flash Gordon</em>. The comic was published in the newspapers beginning in 1934, the year of my mom&#x2019;s birth. He was fascinated by Raymond&#x2019;s drawings, and the design of the strip inspired him to emulate Raymond&#x2019;s skill, matching it with his love for jazz and surrealist culture. He was also a fan of the <em>Flash Gordon</em> film serials that came out of the 1930s, starring Buster Crabbe as Flash. To Wallace, both media were equal, and the serials pretty much followed the pictorial sense of Raymond&#x2019;s vision in the comic strip. My dad later used images from the serials in his film <em>Aleph</em> (1966) and in the Verifax collages, and I think for him, <em>Flash Gordon</em> followed a natural progression from the comic strip to the big screen to his artwork.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He also appreciated the design and costumes in the <em>Flash</em> films; in a way, they were not that different from those of a Diaghilev ballet. Both the <em>Flash Gordon</em> serials and the Ballet Russes were highly in tune with my dad&#x2019;s sense of aesthetics, for my dad without a doubt appreciated the art of dance. There are images of the dance world in his artwork, and he loved ballet. Or, I should point out, he loved the <em>images</em> of the ballet. I don&#x2019;t recall him ever going to, or showing interest in actually attending, a dance recital. But I was raised with a variety of portraits of Vaslav Nijinsky in the family home. He never commented to me about his love for Nijinsky or the ballet. Many people would have sat you down and talked about why they liked a particular artist or entertainer, but not Wallace. His reasons were in his head, and he often showed his love for these artists in his artwork. I believe he felt that his art alone explained everything.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Wallace was also a huge admirer of Nijinsky&#x2019;s diary, the disjointed writings of a man who lost the plot, but nevertheless left a large shadow of genius on its pages. Nijinsky being part of the Ballets Russes (the company started and controlled by Sergei Diaghilev with the help of Picasso, Erik Satie, and Jean Cocteau, among others) also held a tremendous appeal for Wallace. The dance world is a vast spectacle. For a sharp-minded, borderline street thug like my dad, that world must have seemed impossible to attain, but reasonable to imagine. And while he never attended a ballet, Wallace was heavily into swing dancing. It was a portal through which to make progress in another culture, and he was never afraid to step through that entrance to see what was on the other side. One of the many pleasures of big band jazz was the dancing and the whole world within the dance club. Dancing also led to his discovery of numerous musicians who were part of the big bands, and in turn became part of the be-bop movement in jazz. That world never left my father&#x2019;s aesthetic. As much as he took in contemporary music, he never tired of the late &#x2019;40s to early &#x2019;60s experimentation in sound, fury, and beauty known as be-bop.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The earliest artwork that exists to my knowledge by &#x201c;Wally Berman&#x201d; is the cover for Dial Records&#x2019; compilation <em>Be-Bop Jazz</em> (1947), renowned as the first appearance of Charlie Parker on a 78 rpm recording. It&#x2019;s a highly collectible record on two fronts: one, if you&#x2019;re a Charlie Parker fan, this is the holy grail of his recordings; and two, it was the first appearance of Wallace&#x2019;s artwork for public consumption. The label head, Ross Russell, had a record store in Los Angeles that specialized in be-bop, called Tempo Music, which was located at 5946 Hollywood Boulevard. Besides the Downtown Library, this was the crucial location for Wallace. The record store was devoted exclusively to be-bop, and I imagine every great musician had been through its doors. Due to my father&#x2019;s hanging out at the store, Russell hired him to draw the artwork for the cover. Wallace also went to the original recording session with Charlie Parker on March 28, 1946. He saw Parker as one of the great artists of his time, yet he never conveyed his thoughts on the session, or what it was like to be in the presence of Parker, or his favorite singer at the time, Billie Holiday. He told me that he delivered food or perhaps some pot for her, but I can&#x2019;t remember which. Perhaps both?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The drawing had been made when he was a teenager, but Wallace was 20 when he selected it for the cover of <em>Be-Bop Jazz</em>. He also designed the original logo for the Dial label. Jazz has traditionally been an important element in the world of the arts, and Wallace was only one of many who felt its seductive pull. There was just an incredible amount of communication between the visual arts and the music. Around the same time that my dad was hanging out at Tempo Records, Boris Vian in France was in the process of opening the world of American Jazz to the French public through his writing and his activity as an A&amp;R man for various French labels. Although they never met, they clearly belong to the same generation of artists and writers who were drawn to jazz. Wallace had one foot in the jazz culture of his time, and the other in the fine arts. The jazz world called out to my father, and he embraced the sounds and culture with open heart and arms.</p></p><h2>All the People in the Bible: An A-Z Guide to the Saints, Scoundrels, and Other Characters in Scripture</h2><p><i>"More than any other book, the Bible offers an amazing collection of fascinating characters ranging from the holiest of the holy to some of the most depraved scoundrels imaginable.

With the invaluable support of his minions and his attractive, unsinkable wife, Ashworth stands against the amorality and decadence of the age--"Anti-Sex Ashworth." He slays his opponents by being a tough, efficient, confident churchman, the torments of his past long since dead and buried.<br>And then the unexpected, the unthinkable, strikes.<br>Suddenly Ashworth finds himself staring into the chasm of all the lies hes been telling himself for years: about his marriage, his children, even his views on the Church. And as he suspects his old nemesis and dean, Neville Aysgarth, of drinking too much, of financial chicanery, of--God forbid--having an affair, Ashworth discovers to his horror that he is tempted to commit the very acts that he has so publicly <br>denounced. . . .<br>"ENTHRALLING. . .Rich, dense, almost indecently entertaining."<br>--San Jose Mercury News<br>"POWERFUL. . .MIRACULOUS."<br>--Booklist (starred review)<br>SELECTED BY THE BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB</p><p><b>Susan Howatch</b> was born in Surrey. After getting a degree in law, she emigrated to America, where she married, had a daughter, and embarked on a career as a writer.

But the disaster of 1965 walloped me without warning.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ten years have now passed since 1965, but the other day as I embarked on my daily journey through the Deaths Column of The Times, I saw that my old adversary had died and at once I was recalling with great clarity that desperate year in that anarchic decade when he and I had fought our final battle in the shadow of Starbridge Cathedral.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;AYSGARTH, Norman Neville (&#x2018;Stephen&#x2019;),&#x201d; I read. &#x201c;Beloved husband of Dido and devoted father of&nbsp;...&#x201d; But I failed to read the list of offspring. I felt too bereaved. How strange it is that the further one journeys through life the more likely one becomes to mourn the loss of old enemies almost as much as the loss of old friends! The divisions of the past seem unimportant; we become unified by the shrinking of the future.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh God!&#x201d; said my wife, glancing across the breakfast table and seeing my expression. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s died now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Having answered her question I turned from the small entry in the Deaths Column to the many inches of unremitting praise on the obituary page. Did I approve of this fulsome enactment of the clich� Nil nisi bonum de mortuis est? Summoning all my Christian charity I told myself I did. I was, after all, a retired bishop of the Church of England and supposed to radiate Christian charity as lavishly as the fountains of Trafalgar Square spout water. However, I did think that the allocation of three half-columns to this former Dean of Starbridge was a trifle generous. Two would have been quite sufficient.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What a whitewash!&#x201d; commented my wife after she had skimmed through this paean. &#x201c;When I think back to 1965 ...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I thought of 1965, the year of my third catastrophe, the year Aysgarth and I had fought to the finish. Bishops and deans, of course, are not supposed to fight at all. Indeed as senior churchmen they are required to be either holy or perfect English gentlemen or, preferably, both.<br> &nbsp;<br> How we all hanker after ideals, after certainties&#x2014;and after absolute truths&#x2014;which will provide us with security as we struggle to survive in the ambiguous, cloudy, chaotic world which surrounds us! Moreover, although in a rapidly changing society ideals may appear to be swept away by a rising tide of cynicism, the experience of the past demonstrates that people will continue to hunger for those ideals, even when absolute truths are no longer in fashion.<br> &nbsp;<br> Society was certainly changing with great speed in the 1960s, and when I was a bishop I became famous for defending tradition at a time when all traditions were under attack. I had two heroes: St. Augustine, who had proclaimed the absolute truths till the end, even as the barbarians advanced on his city, and St. Athanasius, the bishop famous for being so resolutely contra mundum, against the world, as he fought heresy to the last ditch. By 1965 I had decided that I, like my two heroes, was being obliged to endure a dissolute, demoralised, disordered society, and that my duty was to fight tooth and nail against decadence. A fighting bishop unfortunately has little chance to lead a quiet life, but I decided that was the price I had to pay in order to preserve my ideals.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the 1960s there were three years which now stand out in my memory. The first was 1963, when I clashed with Aysgarth over that pornographic sculpture which he commissioned for the Cathedral churchyard; it was the year Bishop John Robinson wrote his bestseller Honest to God, a book which rocked the Church to its foundations, and the year I wrote in rebuttal A Modern Heresy for Modern Man. That was when I ceased to be merely a conservative bishop, underlining the importance of preserving the accumulated wisdom from the past, and became a fighting bishop contra mundum. The second year which I remember vividly is 1968. That was the year young Nicholas Darrow, my spiritual director&#x2019;s son, was finally ordained after what I suspected was a very shady interval in his private life. It was also the year my son Charley became engaged and my son Michael was married, yet despite these family milestones, 1965 remains the year which is most clearly etched in my memory. Not 1963. Not 1968. But 1965.<br> &nbsp;<br> Let me now describe the man I was before my third catastrophe felled me, the catastrophe which arrived out of the blue. I had been the Bishop of Starbridge for eight years and despite a tentative start I had become highly successful. My sons were both doing well in their chosen careers, and although in their different ways they still worried me, I had come to the conclusion that as a parent I must have been doing something right; at the very least I felt I deserved a medal for paternal endurance. I was on happier ground when I considered my marriage, now almost twenty-eight years old and a perfect partnership.<br> &nbsp;<br> In short, I was not ill-pleased with my life, and stimulated by this benign opinion of myself I travelled constantly around my ecclesiastical fiefdom, spoke forcefully on education in the House of Lords, held forth with confidence on television discussion programmes, ruled various committees with an iron hand and terrorised the lily-livered liberals of the Church Assembly. I also had sufficient zest to maintain my prowess on the golf course and enjoy my wife&#x2019;s company on the days off which she so zealously preserved for me amidst the roaring cataract of my engagements. Occasionally I felt no older than forty-five. On my bad days I felt about fifty-nine. On average I felt somewhere in my early fifties. In fact I was as old as the century, but who cared? I was fit, busy, respected, pampered and privileged. Frequently and conscientiously I thanked God for the outstanding good fortune which enabled me to serve him as he required&#x2014;and what he required, I had no doubt, was that I should fight slipshod thinking by defending the faith in a manner which was tough-minded and intellectually rigorous. St. Augustine and St. Athanasius, I often told myself, would have been proud of me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was proud of me, although of course I had far too much spiritual savoir-faire to do other than shove this secret opinion of myself to the very back of my mind. By 1965 I was too preoccupied by my current battles to waste much time visualising my future obituary in The Times, but on those rare moments when I paused to picture my posthumous eminence, I saw long, long columns of very dense newsprint.<br> &nbsp;<br> God stood by and watched me for some time. Then in 1965 he saw the chance to act, and seizing me by the scruff of the neck he began to shake me loose from the suffocating folds of my self-satisfaction, my arrogance and my pride.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Mistero Buffo: The Collected Plays of Dario Fo, Volume 2</h2><p><p><i>Mistero Buffo</i> is Dario Fo&#x2019;s one-man tour de force, in which he creates his own subversive version of Biblical stories.

As it shot toward me, my whole body flinched-that is, when it came toward me at all, as I stood exiled in far right field, where the team hoped I would do the least damage.<br><br> I was the skinny, uncoordinated kid: the spaz, in the fifth-grade playground lingo of the day. The only game I was good at was dodgeball-not hurling the ball at others, but jumping out of its way. That made perfect sense to me.<br><br> Every recess started with the mortifying ritual of choosing teams. The two captains-big Chuck and quick, wiry Ricky-picked boys from best to worst till they finally came to the slow, heavy kid and me, the dreaded dregs. After much disgusted stalling, one captain would sigh dramatically and say, "OK . . . we'll take Fats if you take Spaz."<br><br> In the classroom, I had no fear. I cheerfully took over discussions, settling back in my seat and enjoying a chummy t te-&#x2c6;-t te with the teacher, only dimly aware of the restless fidgeting going on all around me. Eventually I noticed Chuck, in the back corner near the door, self-exiled to his own right field, head down, trying for once to be small. Hmmmmm . . . a history question shooting toward him threatened as much danger and humiliation as a softball did for me. Different people, different situations, same feeling. Interesting.<br><br> The Cold War was on. In social studies we watched black-and-white propaganda films about communism, with grim narrators and the crablike hammer and sickle squatting over the map of Europe, sprouting evil tentacles of world domination. From time to time, in the middle of a math or geography lesson, the teacher would suddenly shout, "Drop!" We'd fall to our knees and duck and cover under our desks, waiting for an A-bomb to come hurtling toward Woodlake Avenue Elementary School, wondering just how effectively our wooden desktops would shield us from the thermonuclear fireball. Hmmmmm . . .<br><br> Now we're grownups. Terrorists have replaced Communists, and we've graduated from the playground to other grounds for fear: the office, the boardroom, the bedroom, the barroom. And the newsroom. The last presidential election was fueled by fear, and it's been a white-knuckle ride ever since, with spiking anxiety levels reported by psychologists nationwide. The political is personal.<br><br> But no matter who's elected today or impeached tomorrow, our deepest fears persist:<br><br> Fear of pain.<br><br> Fear of confusion.<br><br> Fear of change.<br><br> Fear that things will never change, that this is all there is.<br><br> Fear of responsibility.<br><br> Fear of aging and illness.<br><br> Fear of loss, bereavement, abandonment.<br><br> Fear that the good times are over, that joy has fled.<br><br> Fear of boredom, loneliness, intimacy, violation.<br><br> Fear of failure, rejection, humiliation.<br><br> Fear of others' opinions, of our own feelings, of being fooled, of blowing it onstage, of being exposed as a bewildered child among the confident adults.<br><br> Fear for the planet. We look to the world our children will inherit and wonder if it will be The Jetsons or Mad Max.<br><br> Fear of missing out. For years I was haunted by my high school English teacher's story of his father, who traveled the world, saw the sights, had more adventures than the next ten men, but died screaming-screaming-because he felt that, whatever life was all about, he had missed it.<br><br> Our fears may be rooted in big traumas haunting the past or big challenges looming in the future, but they cast their shadow over the smallest moments of everyday life right now. We're afraid of wearing the wrong outfit to the party, of sounding stupid if we speak up in the meeting, of getting lost if we take the scenic route. Choices must be made, and we long for the time when we chose out of joy (Should I play on the slide or the jungle gym?) rather than fear (Will it be worse if I tell my partner how I feel or keep it to myself?).<br><br>These and the other afflictive emotions-grief, loneliness, guilt, jealousy, confusion, shame, disappointment, resentment, greed, self-righteousness, exasperation, despair-are all deeply connected. Whether they're boiling over into crisis or simmering toxically on a back burner, they're all brewed from fear. They all make us feel unfree and alone. Whether I'm playing my eleventh game of Candy Crush and trying to forget I have a term paper to write, or I'm off in a corner with my spoon and my quart of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, I feel like I'm all alone and no one must know, even when everyone knows.<br><br> Of course, this isn't the whole picture. If you're lucky and you're paying attention, life offers any number of joys and wonders. Many of us manage to sidestep the most destructive habits and scenarios, and to lead reasonably sane, progressive lives. But even in your happiest moments (playing with your healthy, laughing kids), even in your most sublime moments (lost, lost in the music), even in your most thrilling moments (merging in ecstasy with the lover you were born for)-even then, hovering in some dim corner that we try our best to ignore, is the final, definitive fear: your eventual annihilation and that of everything and everyone you love. All this must end. Nevermore, game over, buh-bye, here's your hat, no refunds, no apologies, no exceptions. Death is in the house and demands to be fed. He'll eat you and your little dog too.<br><br> And Yet . . .<br><br> And yet perhaps you've known people for whom this is all somehow different-who seem to have some deep wisdom, some internal gyroscope that keeps them balanced, some inner silence that inoculates them against the standard craziness and panic. Maybe it was an uncle or aunt, a wise teacher or professor, the nice lady at the corner store, the plumber. Maybe your most inspiring exemplars were movie characters: Yoda or Obi-Wan Kenobi, Aslan, Gandalf, Mary Poppins, Glinda the Good Witch. But you're at least vaguely aware that there are supposed to have been real people who have embodied that silent wisdom fully-enlightened people, awakened ones, sages.<br><br> There are.</p><h2>My Father&#39;s Tears: And Other Stories</h2><p><i>&#x201c;Drinking a toast to the visible world, his impending disappearance from it be damned.&#x201d;</i> That&#x2019;s how John Updike describes one of his elderly protagonists in this, his final collection of short stories.

Other&nbsp;cars appeared menacing on it, approaching like bullets,&nbsp;straddling the center strip. Along the roadside, alone in all&nbsp;that sunswept space, little girls in multicolored Berber costume&nbsp;held out bouquets of flowers&#x2014;violets? poppies?&#x2014;&nbsp;which we were afraid to stop and accept. What were we&nbsp;afraid of ? A trap. Bandits. Undertipping, or overtipping. Not&nbsp;knowing enough French, or any Arabic or Berber. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t&nbsp;stop, Daddy, don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; was the cry; and it was true, when we did&nbsp;stop at markets, interested persons out of the local landscape&nbsp;would gather about our rented Renault, peering in and offering&nbsp;unintelligible invitations.&nbsp;<br><br>We were an American family living in England in 1969&nbsp;and had come to Morocco naively thinking it would be, in&nbsp;April, as absolute an escape to the sun as a trip to the&nbsp;Caribbean from the Eastern United States would be at the&nbsp;same time of year.<br><br>But Restinga, where a British travel agency as innocent&nbsp;as we of climatic realities had sent us, was deserted and&nbsp;windy. The hotel, freshly built by decree of the progressive,&nbsp;tourism-minded king, was semicircular in shape. At night,&nbsp;doors in the curving corridors slammed, and a solitary guard&nbsp;in a burnoose kept watch over the vacant rooms and the&nbsp;strange family of pre-season Americans. By day, the waves&nbsp;were too choppy to swim in, and the Mediterranean was not&nbsp;so much wine-dark as oil-black. Walking along the beach, we&nbsp;picked up tar on our feet. When we lay down on the beach,&nbsp;wind blew sand into our ears. Off in the distance, apartment&nbsp;buildings of pink concrete were slowly being assembled, and&nbsp;there were signs that in a month vacationers from somewhere&nbsp;would fill the bleak plazas, the boarded-up arcades.&nbsp;<br><br>But for now there was only the whipping wind, a useless sun,&nbsp;and&#x2014;singly, idly, silently in the middle distance&#x2014;Arabs. Or&nbsp;were they Berbers? Dark men, at any rate, in robes, who&nbsp;frightened our baby, Genevieve. Fantastic as it seems now,&nbsp;when she is so tall and lovely in her spangled disco dress, she&nbsp;was then overweight and eight. Caleb was ten, Mark twelve,&nbsp;and Judith a budding fourteen.&nbsp;<i><br><br>&#x201c;Je le regrette beaucoup,&#x201d; </i>I told the manager of the Restinga&nbsp;hotel, a blue-sweatered young man who wandered about&nbsp;closing doors that had blown open, <i>&#x201c;mais il faut que nous partirons.&nbsp;Trop de vent, et pas de bain de la mer.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Trop de vent,&#x201d; </i>he agreed, laughing, as if reassured that we&nbsp;were not as crazy as we had seemed.&nbsp;<i><br><br>&#x201c;Les enfants sont malheureux, aussi ma femme. Je regrette&nbsp;beaucoup de partir. L&#x2019;h�tel, c&#x2019;est beau, en �t�.&#x201d; </i>I should have&nbsp;used the subjunctive or the future tense, and stopped trying&nbsp;to explain.&nbsp;<br><br>The manager gave our departure his stoical blessing but&nbsp;m y f a t h e r&#x2019;s t e a r s explained, in cascades of financial French, why he could not&nbsp;refund the money we had prepaid in London. So I was left&nbsp;with a little cash, a Hertz credit card, four children, a wife,&nbsp;and plane tickets that bound us to ten more days in Morocco.&nbsp;We took a bus to Tangier. We stood beside an empty road&nbsp;at noon, six stray Americans, chunky and vulnerable in our&nbsp;woolly English clothes with our suitcases full of continental&nbsp;sun togs bought at Lilywhite&#x2019;s and of Penguins for vacation&nbsp;reading. The sun beat upon us, and the wind. The road dissolved&nbsp;at either end in a pink shimmer. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this,&#x201d;&nbsp;my wife said. &#x201c;I could cry.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic the kids,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What else can we do?&#x201d; I&nbsp;asked. &#x201c;There are no taxis. We have no money.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;There must be <i>some</i>thing,&#x201d; she said. Somehow, my memory&nbsp;of the moment has dressed her in a highly unflattering&nbsp;navy-blue beret.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; Genevieve announced, clutching her knapsack&nbsp;and looking painfully hot and rosy in her heavy gray&nbsp;overcoat.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Baby,&#x201d; sneered her big sister, who attracted stares from&nbsp;native men everywhere and was feeling a certain power.&nbsp;&#x201c;The bus will come,&#x201d; Daddy promised, looking over their&nbsp;heads to the vanishing point where the road merged in the&nbsp;pink confusion of the new buildings the king was very slowly&nbsp;erecting.&nbsp;<br><br>A thin dark man in a dirty caftan materialized and spoke to&nbsp;us in a lengthy nasal language. He held out his palms as if to&nbsp;have them read.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Dad, the man is talking to you,&#x201d; Mark, then prepubescent&nbsp;and now a graduate student in computer science, said, very&nbsp;embarrassed.<br><br>&#x201c;I know he is,&#x201d; I told him, helplessly.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he saying, Dad?&#x201d; Genevieve asked.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s asking if this is the bus stop,&#x201d; I lied.&nbsp;<br>The man, continuing to speak, came closer, confiding a&nbsp;breath rich in Muslim essences&#x2014;native spices, tooth decay,&nbsp;pious fasting with its parched membranes. His remarks grew&nbsp;more rapid and urgent, but a light was dying in his bloodshot&nbsp;eyes.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell him to go away.&#x201d; This suggestion came from Caleb,&nbsp;our silent, stoic, sensible child, now a college junior majoring&nbsp;in zoology.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I think he will,&#x201d; I hazarded, and the man did, shaking his&nbsp;skeletal head at our unresponsive idiocy. Our little family&nbsp;clustered closer in relief. Sand blew into our shoes, and the&nbsp;semicircular halls of the abandoned hotel, our only home in&nbsp;this foreign land, howled at our backs like some deep-voiced,&nbsp;clumsy musical instrument.&nbsp;<br><br>The bus! The bus to Tangier! We waved&#x2014;how we&nbsp;waved!&#x2014;and with an incredulous toot the bus stopped. It&nbsp;was the green of tired grass, and chickens in slatted coops&nbsp;were tied to the top, along with rolled-up rugs. Inside,&nbsp;there were Moroccans: dusty hunched patient unknown people,&nbsp;wearing knit little things on their heads and knit little&nbsp;things on their feet, their bodies mixed in with their bundles,&nbsp;the women wrapped in black, some with veils, all eyes glittering&nbsp;upward in alarmed amazement at this onrush of large,&nbsp;flushed, childish Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>The fare, a few dirhams, was taken noncommittally by a&nbsp;driver, who had a Nasseresque mustache and a jaw to match.&nbsp;There was room at the back of the bus. As we wrestled our&nbsp;ponderous suitcases down the aisle, the bus swayed, and I feared we might crush with our bulky innocence this fragile&nbsp;vehicle and its delicately balanced freight. Deeper into the&nbsp;bus, an indigenous smell, as of burned rope, intensified.<br><br>&nbsp;In Tangier, the swaying bus was exchanged for a single&nbsp;overloaded taxi, whose driver in his desire to unload us came&nbsp;into the Hertz office and tried to help the negotiations along.&nbsp;Allah be praised, his help was not needed: the yellow plastic&nbsp;Hertz card that I produced did it all. Had I been able to produce&nbsp;also the pale green of an American Express card, our&nbsp;suspenseful career down the coast, from Tangier to Rabat to&nbsp;Casablanca and then through the narrower streets of El&nbsp;Jadida and Essaouira and Tafraout, would have been greatly&nbsp;eased, for at each hotel it was necessary to beg the clerk to&nbsp;accept a personal check on a London bank, and none but the&nbsp;most expensive hotels would risk it; hence the odd intervals&nbsp;of luxury that punctuated our penurious flight from the&nbsp;Mediterranean winds.&nbsp;<br><br>The avenues of Rabat as we drove into the city were festooned&nbsp;in red. Any thought that we were being welcomed&nbsp;with red banners gave way when we saw hammers and sickles&nbsp;and posters of Lenin. A Soviet high-level delegation, which&nbsp;included Kosygin and Podgorny, was being received by the&nbsp;open-minded king, we discovered at the Rabat Hilton. The&nbsp;hotel was booked so solid with Communists that it could not&nbsp;shelter even the most needy children of free enterprise.&nbsp;<br><br>But a hotel less in demand by the Soviets took us in, and at&nbsp;dinner, starved, we were sat down in a ring on piled carpets,&nbsp;around what in memory seems an immense brass tray, while&nbsp;a laughing barefoot girl tiptoed at our backs, sprinkling rosewater&nbsp;into our hair. Mark, tickled, made his monkey face.&nbsp;<br><br>This sensation of being beautifully served amid undercurrents&nbsp;of amusement recurred in a meadow high above the&nbsp;sea, where, after miles of empty landscape and empty stomachs,<i>&nbsp;</i>a minuscule restaurant, scarcely more than a lean-to,&nbsp;advertised itself with a wooden arrow. We stopped the rented&nbsp;Renault and with trepidation walked across the grass, singlefile,&nbsp;feeling again huge, as when we trod deeper into that fragrant&nbsp;bus. We halted when a man emerged from the shack&nbsp;bearing a table, and a boy emerged carrying chairs. With an&nbsp;air of amusement all around, this furniture was set on the&nbsp;grassy earth, in a spot we lightly indicated. From the shed&nbsp;were produced in time wine, rice, kebabs, and Cokes, which&nbsp;we consumed in sight of the Atlantic, of beige cliffs, and of&nbsp;vast pastures grazed by a single donkey. We were the only&nbsp;customers, for all we knew, that this beautiful restaurant by&nbsp;the sea had ever had.&nbsp;<br><br>Even on the rough back road to Tafraout, into the stony&nbsp;hills of the Low Atlas, with the gas gauge saying zero and not&nbsp;a house, not a sheep or goat, in sight, a little girl in a dip of&nbsp;the unpaved track held out a handful of flowers. The road&nbsp;here had become one with the rocks of a dry riverbed, so our&nbsp;Renault was moving slowly, so slowly she had time, when she&nbsp;saw we were truly not going to stop, to whip our fenders with&nbsp;the flowers and to throw them at the open car window. One&nbsp;or two fell inside, onto our laps. The rest fell onto the asphalt&nbsp;beside her feet. In the rearview mirror I saw the little girl&nbsp;stamp her foot in rage. Perhaps she cried. She was about the&nbsp;age of Genevieve, who expressed empathy and sadness as the&nbsp;girl diminished behind us and dropped from sight.&nbsp;<br><br>In Tafraout, Caleb could not stop staring at a man so badly&nbsp;crippled he seemed a kind of spider, scuttling across the&nbsp;packed earth on his arms, his little body dragged between&nbsp;them. He didn&#x2019;t beg; indeed, he moved about like a local figure&nbsp;of some importance, with urgent business to conduct North of Agadir, we were in our motel rooms watching the&nbsp;minutes to dinnertime crawl by, and became aware that the&nbsp;traffic on the road outside had stopped. Policemen had come&nbsp;quickly, and were talking to the driver of a dusty truck, a&nbsp;young man in soft-colored work clothes slumping against his&nbsp;cab with bowed head, nodding, nodding, as the police asked&nbsp;questions. Traffic was held up on both sides of the road. We&nbsp;stayed on our side, mere tourists, but interested. It was difficult&nbsp;to see what had happened. Some kind of bundle was&nbsp;eclipsed by a wheel of the truck. Under cover of the tumult&nbsp;when the police fetched the mother, Mark crossed the road&nbsp;and looked.&nbsp;<br><br>He was pale when he returned to our side of the road. He&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t make his comical monkey face. We asked him what&nbsp;there was to see. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to see it,&#x201d; was his answer.&nbsp;&#x201c;It was a little girl,&#x201d; he later told us.&nbsp;<br><br>The mother was short and wore black, without a veil; she&nbsp;raced up and down the bare slopes on the other side of the&nbsp;road, splitting the skies with her uncanny keening, her ululating,&nbsp;while men raced after her, trying to pin her down. As&nbsp;they failed to catch her, the excited crowd of them grew, a&nbsp;train of clumsy bodies her grief in its superhuman strength&nbsp;trailed behind her. No American could have made the noise&nbsp;she made; all the breath of her chest was poured upward into&nbsp;the heavens that had so suddenly, powerfully struck her a&nbsp;blow. Ancient modes of lamentation sustained her. Her performance&nbsp;was so naked and pure we turned our heads away.&nbsp;<br><br>We had not been meant to witness this scene in Morocco.&nbsp;When two men caught her at last and pinned her by the&nbsp;arms, she collapsed in a faint.&nbsp;<br><br>We found the climate we had hoped for at Agadir. The&nbsp;beach there was a wide beach but, though the sun and sea&nbsp;were warm enough, almost deserted. We looked for other<i>&nbsp;</i>vacationers to settle near and, seeing none, spread our towels&nbsp;not far from the seawall. Judith wandered a little away from&nbsp;us, gawky and pearly white in her bikini, picking up shells&nbsp;and gazing at the sea, aloof from the company of her parents&nbsp;and her siblings. Genevieve and Caleb began a sand castle.&nbsp;<br><br>Mark lay back and scowled, concentrating upon his tan.&nbsp;We only slowly became aware of the Arab in robes lying&nbsp;thirty yards away, his face turned toward us. His face&#x2014;dark,&nbsp;pentagonal&#x2014;stayed turned in our direction, staring with&nbsp;some thrust of silent pain, of congested avidity, out of the&nbsp;foreshortened rumple of his robes. Genevieve and Caleb fell&nbsp;silent at their castle. Judith drifted closer to us. None of us&nbsp;ventured to the inviting edge of the sea, across the waste of&nbsp;sand, through the silent shimmer of the Arab&#x2019;s stare. So&nbsp;softly the children couldn&#x2019;t hear, Mommy murmured to me,&nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look, but that man is masturbating.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He was. Out of his folds. At Judith and us.&nbsp;<br><br>I stood, my knees trembling, and organized our rapid&nbsp;retreat from the beach, and that afternoon we located the&nbsp;private pool&#x2014;admission a mere dirham&#x2014;where all the&nbsp;Europeans were swimming and tanning safe from the surrounding&nbsp;culture. We went to the pool every day of our five&nbsp;in Agadir. The sun shone and there was little wind. We had&nbsp;found a small hotel run by an old French couple; it was&nbsp;wrapped in bougainvillea, with a parrot in the courtyard and&nbsp;a continental menu.&nbsp;<br><br>Not ten years before, on February 29, 1960, an earthquake&nbsp;in Agadir had killed an estimated twelve thousand people and&nbsp;devastated much of the city. We saw no traces of the disaster.&nbsp;In Agadir we rejoined the middle classes. We had money&nbsp;again. I had cabled my London bank, and they had worked&nbsp;out one of their beloved British &#x201c;arrangements&#x201d; with a bank&nbsp;in Agadir. The bank building had a prim granite facade,&nbsp;erected since 1960, but inside it had more the flavor of a livestock&nbsp;close. Merchants in shepherds&#x2019; robes muttered and&nbsp;waited at a long chaotic counter. As each transaction ripened,&nbsp;names were shouted in Arabic. When my own was shouted&nbsp;out, evidently the amount of money cabled from London&nbsp;was called out with it. The muttering ceased. Astonished&nbsp;brown-eyed glances flew along the counter in my direction. I&nbsp;had swelled to immense size&#x2014;a prodigy, a monster, of&nbsp;money. Blushing, I wanted to explain, as I stuffed the pastel&nbsp;notes into my worn wallet, &#x201c;I have children to feed.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Genevieve liked to feed the dogs that haunted our hotel.&nbsp;Pets in foreign places are strange: to think, they understand&nbsp;French or Arabic better than you do. And they never look&nbsp;quite like American animals, either: a different tilt to their&nbsp;eyes, a different style of walking. Most of our slides, it turned&nbsp;out, were of these animals, out of focus. The children had got&nbsp;hold of the Nikon.</p><h2>Florida&#39;s Fabulous Birds: Land Birds: Their Stories</h2><p>This is an excellent book for the Florida bird watcher.

Thick snowflakes floated past the window. Only the Mill River itself, for which the small Vermont village was named, escaped the snow covering. Its center flowed, black and snakelike, along the edge of the sleeping town.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>With her left hand, Mary stroked a large Siamese cat curled next to her on the adjustable bed. With her right, she tucked a few strands of fine white hair behind her ear. Mary&#x2019;s eyes, one clear and blue, the other gray and cloudy, were fixed on the storm outside.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>She wondered what they would think of her when they discovered what she had done.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>The bedroom was dark, but the few lights from the town shone upward, enough to support a faint reflection of her face on the window glass. Mary looked at the reflection through her good eye. Pale and thin, she was the face of death superimposed on the darkness.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>She drifted in and out of sleep, awakened every few minutes by the excruciating pain in her abdomen. Finally, her hand shaking, she reached for the bottle of pills and the cup of water at her bedside.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Mary poured the pills into her hand and then swallowed them all, a few at a time, with the water. She would leave this world in peaceful solitude. She would do so before her pain was so great&#x2014;before her mental faculties were so diminished&#x2014;that she couldn&#x2019;t leave on her own terms.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>She thought of Michael. The priest had left, as he had promised, but she wondered if he was still awake in the parish house. He would find her tomorrow. She knew it would be difficult for him, but he was prepared for the inevitable. They both were.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Still, she feared what death might bring.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Would she see her husband again? In her dim bedroom, Mary&#x2019;s gaze focused on the outline of a figurine that stood on her bureau. It was a horse, carved elegantly from black marble. She thought of Patrick, of the first time she had seen him when he had come to her father&#x2019;s farm, of the horror that followed.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Mary shuddered and forced her mind to focus on memories of her father instead. She remembered him standing in the round ring, his hat pushed back off his forehead, teaching young horses to be gentle. His belly laugh still rang in her ears.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Even now, having been a widow for more than seventy years, she still feared Patrick, but she longed to see her father again, and Grandpop, too. Perhaps soon she would.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Mary touched Sham&#x2019;s furry head beside her, and the cat mewed and curled his paws in his sleep. Michael had promised to find a good home for him. She had no doubt that he would, and that fact comforted her. Tears ran down her cheeks as she whispered a loving goodbye to her faithful feline companion. Silently, she wished him the happiest of lives, however many he had left, and waited for the final, heavy sleepiness to surround her.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>In Mill River, a handful of others were also awake. Officers Kyle Hansen and Leroy Underwood had been on patrol for more than an hour. The police department&#x2019;s old Jeep Cherokee churned through the new snow as they made their way along the country roads surrounding the town. They had been looking for stranded motorists, but the roads were deserted. Most folks had been sensible enough to stay at home during the storm. Even with the snowfall, the evening, like most evenings in Mill River, had been uneventful.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Leroy was bored. He fidgeted in the passenger seat, squinting out the window. His hair was sandy brown and straight&#x2014;and a little too long for a man in uniform, in Kyle&#x2019;s opinion. His default expression was one of openmouthed confusion, and his shoulders were rounded forward. <i>Hell, anyone unfortunate enough to see Leroy peering out the Jeep&#x2019;s window might easily mistake him for an orangutan,</i> Kyle thought.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Leroy turned from the window and held up an almost empty box of chocolate doughnuts.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You care if I eat the last one?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; Kyle replied. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re stale, you know.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>This fact was lost on Leroy. &#x201c;You think we should drive through town again?&#x201d; he asked, with his mouth full.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Kyle glanced at Leroy and shrugged.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Leroy crammed the last of the doughnut into his mouth and struggled to open the thermos. As they started down the hill back into town, Leroy tried to pour the remaining coffee into the thermos cup, but most of it sloshed into his lap.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Aw, shit. Take it easy with the potholes, would you?&#x201d; he complained.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Kyle rolled his eyes. What Leroy lacked in intelligence and compassion, he made up for in appetite.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Their route took them over the covered bridge spanning the river and onto Main Street. Through the snow, Kyle could just make out the faint white glow of the McAllister mansion high on a hill past the other end of town.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You ever seen her?&#x201d; Leroy asked, following Kyle&#x2019;s gaze.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;The Widow McAllister,&#x201d; Leroy half whispered, as if he were speaking of a ghost.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Kyle said.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I have,&#x201d; Leroy said. &#x201c;Once. Back when I was in high school, outside the bakery. She was all wrinkled and hunched over, with a patch over one eye, like a pirate.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Kyle stared straight ahead, trying to focus on driving through the storm.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I heard that some folks in town&#x2019;s convinced she&#x2019;s a witch or something,&#x201d; Leroy said. &#x201c;Creeps me out, thinking of her up there watching everybody.&#x201d; Leroy flashed a taunting grin at Kyle. &#x201c;Maybe someone should make her walk the plank.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Kyle clenched his jaw. Leroy was trying to irritate him, he knew, and he wasn&#x2019;t going to give him any satisfaction.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>It was easier for Kyle to tolerate Leroy&#x2019;s crudeness when he thought of how difficult it must have been for the junior officer growing up. According to the police chief, who knew almost everyone in town, Leroy was the son of an absentee father and an alcoholic mother. He had an older sister who lived in Rutland. That sister, apparently, was unique in the Underwood family, having finished college and taken a job as an accountant with the city government.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Then there was Leroy. Nearly a high school dropout, he had somehow received his diploma and bungled his way through training at the police academy. He had an ego the size of Texas, and Kyle had yet to see him show real kindness toward anyone. Why Leroy had been hired, Kyle didn&#x2019;t know. Maybe the town had been desperate for another officer, but by Kyle&#x2019;s standards, Leroy was hardly good officer material.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>The old Jeep churned through the snow as they drove back into Mill River. Small, older houses and assorted trailer homes lined this end of Main Street. Most of the residences were dark. One mobile home, though, was brightly lit. In contrast to most of the other trailers, this one was shiny and new. The front yard was filled with ceramic ornaments protruding from the snow&#x2014;a pair of deer, several rabbits, some gnomes, and a large birdbath.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I guess Crazy Daisy&#x2019;s still awake,&#x201d; Leroy said. &#x201c;Probably up fixing a new potion.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>At that moment, the front door of the trailer opened and a dumpling of a woman skipped out into the yard. Kyle slowed the Jeep. Daisy was spinning around, face upturned and tongue stuck out.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Leroy hooted with laughter. &#x201c;Lookit that fat cow!&#x201d; he shouted, oblivious to Kyle&#x2019;s frown. &#x201c;She keeps that up, and she&#x2019;ll trip over one of them rabbits an&#x2019; bite off her tongue!&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Shut up, Leroy,&#x201d; Kyle said. He rolled down the driver&#x2019;s side window.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Ms. Delaine, you know it&#x2019;s late, almost one in the morning, and you shouldn&#x2019;t be outside in this storm,&#x201d; he called to her.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Flushed and breathless, Daisy stopped her twirling and looked at them. A dark port-wine birthmark curled up from her jaw to her cheek, and her gray curls fell over her eyes. She teetered dizzily and brushed her hair from her face. &#x201c;You should try the snow, Officer! I&#x2019;ve been working on a spell for it all evening, and it&#x2019;s delicious!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be perfect in my potions too, but I&#x2019;m in an awful hurry. I&#x2019;m cooking up a new one tonight!&#x201d; Smiling, she scooped up a handful of snow, flung it into the air, waved at Officers Hansen and Underwood, and went inside.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Kyle sat shaking his head, but Leroy roared even louder.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Aw, c&#x2019;mon, Kyle. You know she&#x2019;s nuts. What&#x2019;s the harm in enjoying the entertainment?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;She can&#x2019;t help it, Leroy, and you don&#x2019;t have the good sense to keep your mouth shut when you should,&#x201d; Kyle snapped. He was watching the door of the trailer, making sure Daisy stayed inside.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Ooh, touch-y,&#x201d; Leroy replied. &#x201c;Hell,&#x201d; he said, chuckling again, &#x201c;that show alone makes me sorta happy that she survived that fire. When I heard her trailer&#x2019;d burned, I thought we&#x2019;d finally be rid of the old bat.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Kyle said nothing, despite his disgust, because it would have been useless. He had eight years on Leroy, but given Leroy&#x2019;s level of maturity, it seemed more like eighty. During his time on the force in Boston, he&#x2019;d seen more than a few young officers like Leroy. They were all arrogant and stupid and attracted to the position because they liked the power the uniform and the gun gave them. Most of those guys ended up dead or behind bars themselves, victims of their own bad intentions.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>In Mill River, there were four police officers&#x2014;himself, Leroy, Ron Wykowski, and Joe Fitzgerald, the chief. The problem was that in a town where nothing ever happened, three decent cops were more than enough. Leroy, lacking opportunities to jeopardize his career in a town that had trouble finding officers willing to work for what it could offer in salary, had great job security.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>They continued down Main Street, through the quaint business district, past the white town hall building, and followed the bend in the road past St. John&#x2019;s Catholic Church. One window was lit in the parish house.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Preachie&#x2019;s up,&#x201d; Leroy chirped. This was nothing unusual, though, as Father O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s light was often on late into the night.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>At the next house, there was another bright window.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Teachie&#x2019;s up, too,&#x201d; Leroy said in a different tone. &#x201c;Maybe we should stop by and read her a bedtime story.&#x201d; He raised his eyebrows and slowly ran his tongue across his upper lip.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Teachie&#x201d; was Claudia Simon, the pretty new fourth-grade teacher at Mill River Elementary.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You can read? That&#x2019;s news to me,&#x201d; Kyle said.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Leroy scowled but kept quiet until Kyle pulled up to the police station. As they got out, Leroy stared back down Main Street.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Snow like this makes even those shitty trailers look good.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Again, Kyle didn&#x2019;t respond. All he wanted was a hot shower and a warm bed. It had been a long night.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Claudia Simon was reading bedtime stories of a sort. Each of her students had written a short composition titled, &#x201c;What I Want to Be When I Grow Up.&#x201d; Of the twenty-three fourth-graders, ten wanted to be President of the United States. Six wanted to be movie stars or singers. Four wanted to be doctors or nurses. One a policeman. One a fireman. And one a counselor.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Rowen Hansen was the little girl who wanted to be a counselor. Her father, Kyle Hansen, was a police officer in town. Claudia had learned from the principal that he was a widower. His little girl had written that she wanted to be a counselor, as her mother had been, because she liked to &#x201c;listen to people and help fix their problems.&#x201d; That simple. From a fourth-grader. <i>But,</i> Claudia thought, <i>Rowen is an exceptional kid.</i><br></p><p> <br></p><p>Claudia stood up and stretched. It was after one. But this was Saturday night&#x2014;no, now Sunday morning&#x2014;and if she lost herself grading papers, she could sleep late. Dressed in a jogging suit and socks, she padded down the hall to the bathroom to brush her teeth. She examined her reflection in the full-length mirror on the back of the bathroom door. Only a few months ago, her reflection wouldn&#x2019;t have fit in the mirror.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Single, obese, and lonely, Claudia had resolved, on her thirtieth birthday, to get herself into shape. She had made that resolution many times before. She had been overweight all her life, or as much of it as she could remember. She had never had a boyfriend, a prom date, or even so much as a man with a romantic interest in her. After that long, most people would have resigned themselves to a lifetime of solitary cheesecake. Instead, Claudia threw out the cheesecake, chips, ice cream, and pizza. She purchased a treadmill and Reeboks. Then, over the next year and a half, Claudia literally ran her ass off.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Now, ninety-two pounds lighter, Claudia examined her reflection with approval and headed to bed. She had a new wardrobe in a size ten. She had a teaching job in a school in a new town where people didn&#x2019;t know her former fat self. She was alive. A single ready to mingle. She would get over her social awkwardness. She wouldn&#x2019;t get flustered when she saw an attractive man. She wouldn&#x2019;t avert her eyes. She was no longer ashamed of herself.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>That night, Claudia fell asleep smiling.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>It was well after midnight, but Jean Wykowski couldn&#x2019;t sleep. Her husband, Ron, lay snoring beside her. His shift at the police station would begin at seven, and he was oblivious to her tossing and turning. But Ron&#x2019;s snoring rarely bothered her, and it was not the reason that she experienced insomnia. Finally, she slipped from under the covers and tiptoed out of the bedroom.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>On her way to the kitchen, she paused at her sons&#x2019; room. Jimmy and Johnny, ages nine and eleven, took after their father where sleep was concerned. Both were out cold, their breathing slow and rhythmic. Jimmy looked just as she had left him at bedtime. He lay on his back with the covers pulled up to his chin. Johnny, though, was turned around with his feet on his pillow and his head very close to falling off one side. How he had managed that Jean didn&#x2019;t know, but she was able to coax him back under the covers in the proper direction without fully waking him.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Jean continued to the darkened kitchen, wincing every time the fl...</p></p><h2>Love Cemetery: Unburying the Secret History of Slaves</h2><p><p> By the eve of the Civil War, there were four million slaves in North America, and Harrison County was the largest slave-owning county in Texas. So when China Galland returned to research her family history there, it should not have surprised her to learn of unmarked cemeteries for slaves. "My daddy never let anybody plow this end of the field," a local matron told a startled Galland during a visit to her antebellum mansion. "The slaves are buried there." Galland's subsequent effort to help restore just one of these cemeteries&#x2014;Love Cemetery&#x2014;unearths a quintessential American story of prejudice, land theft, and environmental destruction, uncovering racial wounds that are slow to heal. </p> <p> Galland gathers an interracial group of local religious leaders and laypeople to work on restoring Love Cemetery, securing community access to it, and rededicating it to the memories of those buried there. In her attempt to help reconsecrate Love Cemetery, Galland unearths the ghosts of slavery that still haunt us today. Research into county historical records and interviews with local residents uncover two versions of history&#x2014;one black, one white. Galland unpacks these tangled narratives to reveal a history of shame&#x2014;of slavery and lynching, Jim Crow laws and land takings (the theft of land from African-Americans), and ongoing exploitation of the land surrounding the cemetery by oil and gas drilling. With dread she even discovers how her own ancestors benefited from the racial imbalance. </p> <p> She also encounters some remarkable, inspiring characters in local history. Surprisingly, the original deed for the cemetery's land was granted not by a white plantation owner, but by Della Love Walker, the niece of the famous African-American cowboy Deadwood Dick. Through another member of the Love Cemetery committee, Galland discovers a connection to Marshall's native son, James L. Farmer</p></p><p><p>Born and raised in Texas, China Galland is the award-winning author of <em>Longing for Darkness</em> and <em>The Bond Between Women</em>. She received a Hedgebrook Writers Invitational Residency and has won awards for her writing from the California Arts Council. Galland is a professor in residence at the Center for the Arts, Religion, and Education at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California, where she directs the Keepers of Love Project. She lectures, teaches, and leads retreats nationally and internationally on religion, race, and reconciliation. </p>Galland chronicles the restoration and reconsecration of an African-American cemetery in her East Texas childhood hometown in this inspirational first-person account. The author, who is white, uncovers a fragment of local history in the process of her participation in an interracial group of people who from 2003 to 2006 convened a series of "work parties" at the cemetery&#x2014;hacking at weeds, repairing gravestones and making offerings to the ancestors. Galland reports the meetings, church services and potluck suppers she joins in around the communal cleanup of Love Cemetery, which may date back to the 1830s. She portrays the Boy Scout troop, various clergy, parishioners and the community elders ("keepers of the group memory") involved in the effort, with especially nuanced portraits of two African-American women, Doris Vittatoe (a direct descendant of a man buried there) and Nuthel Britton (the unofficial cemetery caretaker). Galland (<i>The Bond Between Women,</i> 1998), who leads spiritual retreats, was acutely aware of "the dissonance between the black and white experience of life in America," but comes to her own "understanding that enormous change happens through tiny choices." Despite some slack passages, this fresh if not always coherent tale will appeal to women readers eager for an uplifting story. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(Anne Tyler, <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>)<br><br>"Trevor's is among the most subtle and sophisticated fiction being written today." (John Banville, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Claude Rains: An Actor&#39;s Voice (Screen Classics)</h2><p>Late in Claude Rains's distinguished career, a reverent film journalist wrote that Rains "was as much a cinematic institution as the medium itself." Given his childhood speech impediments and his origins in a destitute London neighborhood, the ascent of Claude Rains (1889&#x2013;1967) to the stage and screen is remarkable. Rains's difficulties in his formative years provided reserves of gravitas and sensitivity, from which he drew inspiration for acclaimed performances in <i>The Invisible Man</i> (1933), <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> (1939), <i>Casablanca</i> (1942), Notorious (1946), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), and other classic films. In <i>Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice</i>, noted Hollywood historian David J. Skal draws on more than thirty hours of newly released Rains interviews to create the first full-length biography of the actor who was nominated multiple times for an Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor. Skal's portrait of the gifted actor also benefits from the insights of Jessica Rains, who provides firsthand accounts of the enigmatic man behind her father's refined screen presence and genteel public persona. As Skal shows, numerous contradictions informed the life and career of Claude Rains. He possessed an air of nobility and became an emblem of sophistication, but he never shed the insecurities that traced back to his upbringing in an abusive and poverty-stricken family. Though deeply self-conscious about his short stature, Rains drew notorious ardor from female fans and was married six times. His public displays of dry wit and good humor masked inner demons that drove Rains to alcoholism and its devastating consequences. Skal's layered depiction of Claude Rains reveals a complex, almost inscrutable man whose nuanced characterizations were, in no small way, based on the more shadowy parts of his psyche. With unprecedented access to episodes from Rains's private life, Skal tells the full story of the consummate character actor of his generation. <i>Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice</i>, gives voice to the struggles and innermost concerns that influenced Rains's performances and helped him become a universally respected Hollywood legend.</p><p><b>David J. Skal</b>, the author of numerous books about film and popular culture, including <i>Hollywood Gothic</i> and <i>The Monster Show</i>.<br><br><b>Jessica Rains</b>, the only child of Claude Rains, is a producer and actress."[Claude Rains] was perfect. There's a very small group of actors who seemingly never made a mistake: Walter Huston, Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, and Claude Rains."&#x2015;Roddy McDowell<p>"[Claude Rains] was witty, amusing, and beautiful. And thoroughly enchanting to be with. And brilliant."&#x2015;Bette Davis</p><p>"Claude Rains was a consummate actor whose remarkable life and career has been covered in fascinating detail in this book."&#x2015;Kevin Brownlow</p><p>"Most movie stars eventually are forgotten, and almost all character actors are, but the reputation of Claude Rains has survived for more than 40 years since his death. David Skal's biography, written with Rains' daughter, probably will provoke even more welcome&#x2015;and justified&#x2015;reassessments of his gifts."&#x2015;Scott Eyman, <i>Cox News Service</i></p><p>"This highly readable biography, written with the help of his daughter, Jessica Rains, reeals the witty, talented man behind this universally respected Hollywood legend."&#x2015;<i>Tuscan Citizen</i></p><p>"A comprehensive, breezily written guide to a consummate gentleman and an ever-dlligent pro."&#x2015;<i>Post and Courier</i></p><p>"The book has an excellent appendix detailing Rain's theatre and film work, and a good bibliography and index."&#x2015;<i>Mary of Many Colors</i></p><p>"It's a fast, compelling read, leaving readers to reach their own conclusions."&#x2015;<i>Expressionmilwaukee.com</i></p><p>"Well-researched, competently written biography of the English actor."&#x2015;Robert Nott, <i>Sante Fe New Mexican</i></p><p>"<i>Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice</i> seeks to shine the spotlight on one of the sharpest and most elegant stars of classical Hollywood cinema. . . .

The cyclical nature of violent regimes and their overthrow is delineated in these recurring images of sin, martyrdom, and retribution that have sustained the Jewish people despite pogroms, massacres, and expulsions -- from the destruction of the First Temple through the Holocaust to the eventual return to their homeland.</p><p>Editor Roskies, author of Against the Apocalypse (Harvard Univ. Pr., 1986), here presents a massive anthology of Jewish literary responses to catastrophe and persecutions from the Bible to the post-World War II era. In both the general introduction and specific introductions to each of the 20 historical periods, he clearly and succinctly explains the reason for the inclusion of each document, its place in the literary or historical tradition, and, where necessary, its relation to world literature. The anthology includes 100 documents, some appearing for the first time in English. Included are short stories, three novellas, poetry, sermons, chronicles, memoirs, and works set to music. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Maurice Tuchman, Hebrew Coll.

At its centre are three stories connected into one marvellously rich narrative about Juliet - who escapes from teaching at a girls&#39; school and throws herself into a wild and passionate love match. Here are men and women of wildly different times and circumstances, their lives made vividly palpable by the nuance and empathy of Munro&#39;s writing. &#34;Runaway&#34; is about the power and betrayals of love, about lost children, lost chances. There is pain and desolation beneath the surface, like a needle in the heart, which makes these stories more powerful and compelling than anything she has written.</p><p>Alice Munro has been accused of telling the same story over and over, and to a certain extent the characterization is true. Her subject matter is inevitably the vagaries of love between middle-aged people in some rural Canadian setting, trapped there by the combination of their desires and weaknesses. Or, if not love, then at least the mysteries of relationships as characters struggle to understand each other and themselves. But this thematic single-mindedness can hardly be considered a criticism considering Munro tells stories better than anybody else and with a level of precision matched by few. It would be like criticizing Shakespeare for writing about politics.<p> <i>Runaway</i> is no exception. The stories take place throughout Canada--northern Ontario, the Prairies, the West Coast, Stratford--and feature women and men drifting in and out of each other's orbits, pulled by forces they don't understand. In "Runaway," a woman considers leaving her husband with the help of a neighbor, but the husband has other plans. In "Chance," a woman leaves her life behind in a quest for a man she met on a train crossing the country. Their intertwined lives play out through two more stories, "Soon" and "Silence," but the path they follow is as unpredictable to the reader as it is to them. In "Trespasses," a small town's women dream of escaping their lives only to find themselves in lives they never imagined.</p><p> What really marks the stories is Munro's sense of mood. There's a sense of hidden menace or even violence everywhere in <i>Runaway</i>. It occasionally erupts, but always in surprising and unexpected ways, and with unintended consequences. Munro may be an old-fashioned storyteller, but she understands chaos theory well enough. The same story? Sure. But it's a damn good one. <i>--Peter Darbyshire, Amazon.ca</i></p>""Runaway" is the first story in this stunning collection, sure to be a runaway success. All of the eight stories here are new, published in book form for the first time. Two of the eight have never appeared anywhere, so this will be a special feast for the millions of Munro fans around the world. <br>Miraculously, these stories seem to have been written by a young writer at the peak of her powers. Alice Munro's central characters range from 14-year-old Lauren in "Trespass," through the young couple in "Runaway," whose helpful older neighbour intervenes to help the wife escape, all the way to a 70-year-old woman meeting a friend of her youth on a Vancouver street and sitting with him to recall their tangled lives fifty years earlier, through a web of cheerful lies. <br>Three of the stories, "Chance," "Soon," and "Silence," are linked, showing us how the young teacher Juliet meets her fisherman lover on a train (and, by terrible chance, visits his B.C. home on the day after his wife's funeral); how, years later, she brings baby Penelope back east to show her parents and learns sad secrets about their marriage; and how, twenty years on, she visits the estranged Penelope in her cult-like B.C. community. The result is more powerful than most novels, a quality in Alice Munro's stories that has been noted by many reviewers. <br>The final story, "Powers," spans 50 years and runs from Goderich to Vancouver and involves a cast of four characters, each of whom steps forward to dominate the scene, not least Tessa, the plain girl whose psychic powers take her on the vaudeville circuit. But it is Alice Munro's own powers that dominate this collection and that will amaze reviewers and readers. Howcan she keep getting better? How can any one person know so much about the heads and hearts of so many different people? And how can she weave them together in stories that delight academics and ordinary readers alike, making each new Alice Munro book a runaway bestseller? <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Gun Digest Shooter&#39;s Guide to the AR-15</h2><p><p>Welcome to the world of the AR-15!</p><p>Without a doubt, the AR-15 and AR-10 rifles are two of America's most popular semi-auto long guns.

In 1876, Wickham smuggled 70,000 rubber tree seeds out of the rainforests of Brazil and delivered them to Victorian England's most prestigious scientists at Kew Gardens. The story of how Wickham got his hands on those seeds-and the history-making consequences-is the stuff of legend. <i>The Thief at the End of the World</i> is an exciting true story of reckless courage and ambition that perfectly captures the essential nature of Great Britain's colonial adventure in South America.</p><p><b>Joe Jackson</b> is the author of four works of nonfiction and a novel. He was an investigative reporter for the Norfolk<i> Virginian-Pilot</i> for 12 years, covering criminal justice and the state&#x2019;s death row. He lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He can be reached through his website, joejacksonbooks.com.<p>Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley</p><p>On June 10, 1876, a self-styled explorer and adventurer named Henry Wickham arrived at Liverpool with his wife, Violet, having sailed from Brazil. He hastened to London and the offices of the Royal Botanic Gardens, commonly known as Kew Gardens, where he immediately presented the director, Joseph Dalton Hooker, with a sample of the precious cargo he had brought: 70,000 seeds of "the valuable rubber known as 'Par� fine,' " its proper botanical name being Hevea brasiliensis, or simply hevea, as Joe Jackson refers to it in The Thief at the End of the World. </p><p>Wickham had committed, as Jackson writes in this excellent account of his life and its lasting consequences, an act of "biopiracy." He had stolen seeds native to the Amazon forest and made them available to imperial Britain for planting in its Asian colonies. Jackson writes: </p><p>"Henry's theft was no different than that by scores of others before him -- and yet, in a fundamental way, it was. He did not steal one seed, or even a hundred; he stole seventy thousand. . . .Thirty-four years after Henry's theft, the British rubber grown in the Far East from Henry's seeds would flood the world market, collapsing the Amazon economy in a single year and placing in the hands of a single power a major world resource. In 1884, the state of Amazonas levied a heavy export tax on rubber seeds, and in 1918, Brazil banned their export entirely. By 1920, when Henry was being knighted and called the 'father of the rubber industry' in Great Britain, Brazilians dubbed him the 'executioner of Amazonas,' 'the prince of thieves,' and called his theft 'hardly defensible in international law.' " </p><p>The effects of Wickham's theft were nothing short of stupendous. Though it took a long time for his seeds to take root and begin to produce rubber trees -- a period in which Wickham was scorned by Britain's scientific establishment -- eventually "hevea seeds were sent all over the world -- to Selangor in Malaya, Malacca, British Borneo, India, Burma, German East Africa, Portuguese Mozambique, and Java," and in 1913, just as World War I was about to begin -- with the huge demand for rubber it would generate -- Britain's triumph was sealed: </p><p>"That year, the British plantations turned the corner and produced 47,618 tons of high-quality, acetate-cured rubber compared to Brazil's 39,370 tons. In 1916, Brazil produced as much as ever, but the game had now changed. In three more years, British plantations would produce enough hevea to fill 95 percent of the world's need for high-quality rubber. Such fantastic supply seemed unimaginable just a few years earlier, and the price plummeted from the $3.06 high in 1910 to 66 cents per pound in 1915. By 1921, when Great Britain controlled the world market, plantation rubber sold for 12-21 cents a pound." </p><p>Wickham's story is dramatic and interesting in and of itself, but obviously its ramifications go far beyond its immediate details. "Biopiracy," as Jackson says, at its core "is about power and its imbalance -- the historical fact that poorer countries have been high in resources, while richer nations want -- and can take -- what they have." What Wickham did "became a symbol for every act of exploitation visited on the Third World" and raised an issue that probably never will be resolved: "Who owns the earth's riches?" Though "current international law holds that nations own their resources," common practice remains that "nature, and her 'improvement,' belongs to mankind," or, more bluntly, to whoever has the power to control it. </p><p>Thus it is no small irony that Wickham, though hungry for fame at a time when "the explorer was a central hero in an escape fantasy that gripped the British isles, a champion who trod the earth's wild places and interpreted what he saw through English eyes," was himself not unduly avaricious and whiled away his last years "poor, frightfully poor, spending most of his time at the Royal Colonial Club, surrounded by fellow imperialists, each spinning their separate tales." He was born in 1846 into a modestly prosperous family for which everything changed with his father's sudden death four years later, leaving his mother to support three small children through her very marginal work as a milliner. Henry seems to have been a dreamy boy who for a long time wanted to be an artist and showed some talent at it, but he was determined to regain such status as his family had lost and, like many in those days, thought that could be accomplished in the Americas.</p><p>So in the summer of 1866, the 20-year-old Wickham headed for the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua. Two years later he had found his way to the Orinoco, working as a rubber tapper, aiming to set himself up on a plantation and to enjoy all the prestige that a planter's life entailed. He never really achieved that dream, there or anywhere else, but he learned a great deal about rubber. He also learned a great deal about tropical insects and tropical diseases, all of which Jackson describes in vivid, mildly nauseating detail. On any number of occasions Wickham could have died, but clearly he was a survivor, perhaps in part because he inhabited his own universe. Many years later he was deftly described as "a large-framed idealist, dreamy, sympathetic, artistic, a great wanderer and naturalist in tropical America, but not well qualified for official or commercial business." </p><p>More than anything, he was the right man at the right moment. He arrived in South America at "the beginning of what investors in New York and London called the Rubber Age." By 1860, "it had become obvious . . . that with the discovery of vulcanization, rubber would be the world's most useful plastic," employed in everything from telegraph wires to transatlantic cables to railroads to any number of essential applications in modern warfare. Between 1880 and 1910, "the three great developments dependent on rubber -- electricity, bicycles, and automobiles -- increased its worldwide demand at a rate that nearly doubled production every five, then every three years." Wickham was more an instrument of rubber's hegemony than a master of it, but the rubber boom would not have taken place as it did without him. No doubt someone else would have figured out how to smuggle hevea seeds out of Brazil and into the arms of Mother England, but Wickham was the one who pulled it off. </p><p>He had been in the jungle for a decade before he brought the seeds to Kew. He had tried his luck in various places with mostly discouraging results, but he declined to be discouraged. After yet another failure, this one only a couple of years before he stole the seeds, he became "a true believer in the British doctrine of world transformation, that nature's secrets could be secured and replanted -- all for the improvement of man, the empire and her queen." When Kew found out about him and offered him a reward should he succeed in bringing rubber seeds out of the jungle, he seems to have accepted the assignment not so much in hopes of personal gain -- though he was scarcely without such desire -- as from a peculiarly Victorian sense of patriotism. </p><p>Wickham, like all the more celebrated explorer/adventurers of his day, is a creature of the past. Big corporations now do the dirty work of extracting the Third World's resources and delivering them for the convenience of those of us in more privileged circumstances. But his remains a cautionary tale, as Jackson well understands. Exploitation is exploitation, no matter how it is done and by whom. Trade agreements that open the United States and other major markets to goods from poorer countries redress the balance to a degree, but the wildly disproportionate consumption of the world's resources by its richest countries continues, with no end in sight. </p><p>Jackson has made a first-rate book out of Wickham's story. A freelance writer and former newspaper reporter who works out of Virginia Beach, he has done a heroic amount of research, made a coherent story out of a huge mass of material and identified the larger themes that give the story its resonance. His writing is lucid, occasionally vivid, and he brings to the enterprise a welcome sense of humor, as well as, when it is useful, a sense of the ridiculous. The Thief at the End of the World not merely is informative and instructive, it also is immensely entertaining, an attribute always to be welcomed. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

What something really is (its true being) is believed to be hidden behind the 'mere appearances' through which it manifests. Twentieth-century European thinkers radically overturned this way of thinking. 'Appearance' began to be taken seriously, with the observer participating in the dynamic event of perception.</p> <p>In this important book, Henri Bortoft guides us through this dynamic way of seeing, exploring issues including how we distinguish things, how we find meaning, and the relationship between thought and words.</p> <p>Expanding the scope of his previous book, <em>The Wholeness of Nature</em>, Bortoft shows how Goethean insights combine with this dynamic way of seeing in continental philosophy, to offer an actively experienced 'life of meaning'.</p> <p>This book will be of interest to anyone who wants to understand the contribution and wider implications of modern European thought in the world today.</p></p><p>Henri Bortoft (1938-2012) was a physicist with an interest in the history of science and continental philosophy. He authored the well-received book, The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe&#39;s Way of Science (Floris Books, 1996, 2005).<p>'Henri Bortoft is one of the world's foremost experts on Goethean science...

When the text falls into the hands of Rabbi Kalman Stern, he has no idea that his lonely life of intellectual pursuits is about to change once he opens the book. Soon afterward, he meets astronomer Isabel Benveniste, a woman of science who stirs his soul as no woman has for many years. But Kalman has much to learn before he can unlock his heart and let true love into his life. The key lies in the mysterious document he finds inside the Zohar, the master text of the Kabbalah.</p></p><p><p>LAWRENCE KUSHNER is a rabbi, writer, and teacher who has authored over a dozen books on Jewish mysticism and spirituality. He is a regular contributor to NPR's <i>All Things Considered</i> and the<i> New York Times.</i> Kushner currently lives in San Francisco with his wife, Karen.</p>* One *<br>MANHATTAN<br><br>On this day the light had disguised itself as the first ordinary orange rays of a September sunrise over the East River. It easily eclipsed the big red neon Tower Records sign and silhouetted all the sheets of newspaper scurrying over Broadway's empty sidewalks. It ricocheted off the windows on the building across the street and then flooded Kalman's office. And for a moment, light was everywhere. And everything was light.<br><br>Kalman opened the door and squinted in the brightness. Winded from climbing three flights up the utility stairwell, he was proud his forty-six-year-old constitution could still take them in stride. He set his coffee on the desk, hung his parka over the back of a chair, and began unpacking his bag--teaching notes, books, a folder of last week's marked-up homework. Finally, he peeled the tape from the flap of a bubble-wrap envelope protecting a very old volume of Zohar, the master text of Kabbalah. Kalman had picked it up in Israel decades earlier; the caretaker of a little out-of-the-way synagogue had given it to him.<br><br>"Here," the old man had said. "Take it, it's yours--has your name on it."<br><br>So he took it. He'd been using it ever since as a pedagogic prop, a teaching aid for his courses on mysticism. How could he possibly have imagined that, after all these years, the back cover of the book was about to come unglued and give birth to another page? That's the way it is with a good book: Just when you think you've read all its words, the damn thing falls apart in your hands and you have to start all over again.<br><br>The leather of the cover was long gone; only the interior pastedowns had survived the continents and centuries. Similarly, all that remained of the binding was naked stitch work. The back cover was even more distressed--a sandwich of several barely-glued-together and delaminating layers. The extremes of New York's climate had taken their toll on whatever adhesive properties the old glue might still have possessed. Indeed, the book was so insubstantial, it seemed more pneumatic than corporeal--a child's helium balloon in imminent danger of floating away. The paper of the pages had a bluish cast and was so softly textured, it felt like cloth; wormholes embroidered the edges and much of the gutter. Many margins were embellished with handwritten notes. The title page bore the names or biblical verses poetically alluding to the names of generations of owners. And at the bottom there was printed a verse from the Book of Job: "What is hidden shall come into the light."<br><br>Then, like a man swearing an oath in court, Kalman placed his open palm on the book and mused, "And what was hidden has come to me!" He closed his eyes and smiled.<br>Kalman's office was at the back of the library stacks, a destination distinguished primarily by the fact that it could be reached from the stairway door by at least half a dozen different paths. And each one was through a different maze of aisles created by floor-to-ceiling gray metal shelves of books and--if you bothered to flip on the switches as you walked by--illuminated by overhead fluorescent lights. There were routes for every mood: You could walk through medieval Europe and the Holocaust; you could walk through commentaries on the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, or the Koran; you could walk through the Talmud, the history of Israel, Jewish ethics, or Jewish humor. But no matter which path you chose, it was through books, literally thousands and thousands of them, all waiting patiently for readers like flowers for bees.<br><br>"So you're interested in becoming a rabbi. . . ." Kalman set down her letter and smiled at the red-haired young woman sitting on the other side of his desk.<br><br>"Yes, I am, Rabbi Stern. I'm particularly interested in Kabbalah."<br><br>"Which is why, I suppose, the dean asked me to meet with you."<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>Kalman looked over his reading glasses. "Does God talk to you?"<br><br>"Not that I know of."<br><br>"Well, that's a good sign."<br><br>"I majored in classics and religion at Brown. I even took a year of Hebrew. For the past several years, I have tried Buddhist meditation, spent six months in India on an ashram, and then last year I had an epiphany. I was at my nephew's bar mitzvah, and it dawned on me that Judaism must have something mystical, too."<br><br>"Indeed," said Kalman. He reached over, picked up the Zohar, and handed it to her. "Be gentle, it's very, very old."<br><br>"When was it published?"<br><br>"Look at this line, here," he said, pointing to the verse from Job at the bottom of the title page.<br><br>"Why are some of the letters bigger than the others?"<br><br>"Gematria."<br><br>"You mean where each letter has a numerical equivalent?"<br><br>"Excellent." He handed her a pencil and a notepad. "How's your arithmetic?"<br><br>"You'll have to help me."<br><br>"Let's first wait and see if you need any. . . . Remember, only the <i>big</i> letters."<br><br>"Okay," she said, "<i>Ayin</i> is . . . Wait, don't tell me, <i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>samekh</i>, <i>ayin</i>, yes, seventy; <i>lamed</i> is thirty; <i>yod</i> is ten. . . . <i>Tsadi</i>. What's <i>tsadi</i>?"<br><br>"Ninety," said Kalman.<br><br>"Thank you. The <i>alephs</i>, of course, is one; the <i>vav</i> is six; and the <i>resh</i> is . . ."<br><br>"Two hundred. Relax, this is not a test."<br><br>She tallied the numbers and replied with a hesitant grin, "Four hundred and eight?"<br><br> "Bingo!" said Kalman, clapping his hands together in mock applause. "Pub date hidden in a scriptural verse."<br><br>"But how is four hundred and seven a date?"<br><br>"The publisher assumes you know which millennium you're in. So you add the present millennium and get 5407. Then subtract that from the current Hebrew year, 5757, leaving 350. Finally, subtract that from this year, 1997, which tells us the book was published in 1647. Piece of cake. And if that's too complicated for you, just add 240 to the Hebrew year and correct for the proper millennium."<br><br>"But I don't understand, Rabbi Stern. Why didn't they just put the date?"<br><br>"Because the publisher believed that everything worth knowing is already in the Hebrew Bible. That's what it means to say that God gave it. We only have to learn how to read and interpret those words correctly. That's what we're supposed to be doing here in this school: learning how to read them properly."<br>SAFED: ITERATION ONE<br><br>Kalman watched while the young woman contemplated the book in her hands.<br><br>"It's really beautiful, Rabbi Stern. What is it?"<br><br>"The red letters at the top of the page."<br><br>Falteringly, she sounded out the three words: "<i>Ha-Zohar al ha-Torah</i>. The Zohar on the Torah--awesome!" Her cheeks flushed. "I've read about it, but I've never seen one before."<br><br>"You are holding the first of a three-volume set that purports to be the transcript of the peripatetic teachings and adventures of the second-century mystic Shimon bar Yohai and his companions as they wander the Galilean hills. Like other rabbinic texts, it humbly claims only to elaborate on the real meaning of the Bible. Gershom Scholem . . . you know about him?"<br><br>"Historian of mysticism?"<br><br>"Yes. Scholem once pointed out that, in a revealed religion like Judaism, creativity must masquerade as commentary."<br><br>"I don't understand."<br><br>"If everything worth knowing is already in the Torah, then no one can say anything new of any real value. So if you're a Jew and you have a creative idea, you must begin by demonstrating how it's already in scripture."<br><br>"And so that's why the Zohar claims to elucidate the Torah?"<br><br>"Correct. It was Scholem who also first suggested that the Zohar is a mystical novel. That would make the Zohar a treatise on Kabbalah that has been disguised to <i>look like</i> a commentary on the Torah, which, in turn, is masquerading as a novel. Scholars now agree with Scholem that it was pseudepigraphically written by the Castilian Kabbalist Moshe de Leon toward the end of the thirteenth century."<br><br>"It sort of gives ghostwriting a new dimension, doesn't it," she said.<br><br>Kalman laughed. "Well, if you believe in the transmigration of souls, I suppose. According to at least one document, Moshe de Leon feared that no one would read something he wrote, so he invented--or I suppose you could say channeled--a more prestigious author. But whoever wrote it, the Jews bought the whole thing. After the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud, the Zohar has effectively become the third canonical sacred text in Judaism."<br><br>"May I ask, Rabbi, how you got the book?"<br><br>He rotated it in his hands, examining it in the light. "It's actually a pretty good story," Kalman said. "The caretaker of a little synagogue up in Safed gave it to me. It must've been twenty, maybe twenty-five years ago. I was leading a tour of Israel for members of my part-time congregation. We were up in Safed, in the Galilee. After visiting the synagogue of Isaac Luria, the group had had enough of my history of Kabbalah and wanted to go shopping in the artists' quarter. So I wandered off down the hillside, alone. Within only a few blocks the buildings began to thin out and the narrow street became just a rocky, zigzag path down the side of the mountain. That's when I noticed the entrance to the courtyard of a small Spanish-Portuguese-style synagogue. I was tired, the gate was ajar, and the place was deserted. So I walked in. . . ."<br>Kalman closed his eyes for a moment, recalling that old Mediterranean prayer hall. Its ceiling was high--easily two stories--and supported by four slightly pointed, white plastered arches that, in turn, rested upon columns. Each column was painted a bright, high-gloss blue. Most of the windows had bright blue curtains that billowed lazily with every passing breeze. The big stone blocks paving the floor had been worn to a shine by the foot-shuffle genuflections of generations of worshippers. Every inch of mortar between every block of pavement was also painted bright azure. The bottom half of all four walls was also a bright, high-gloss blue.<br><br>Blue: the color of the sea and the color of the sky. "And beneath God's feet was the likeness of sapphire stones, like the purity of the sky itself"--Exodus 24:10. And blue: the color associated with God's fleeting feminine presence.<br><br>The top half of the room and ceiling was white and festooned with a haphazard array of fluorescent lights, space heaters, bare incandescent bulbs, chandeliers, and sconces for candles, as well as an assortment of electric fans. The walls were interrupted regularly with cushioned benches and alcoves for bookshelves. Along the far wall were six high, narrow, arched windows. They had neither screens nor glass. Birds occasionally flew in and out. Rays of afternoon sunlight flitted across the prayer desks and bookshelves, igniting them, one after another, with flashes of white light. And in the center, several feet above floor level, stood an ornate pulpit surrounded by a turquoise railing.<br>"It was the most mysteriously beautiful place I think I've ever been in," said Kalman. "I just stood there, mesmerized by the sunlight and the twittering of the birds, when the caretaker, an old Moroccan-looking man, startled me out of my reverie. . . ."<br>"<i>Mincha</i> doesn't start for a few hours."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"The afternoon service, it doesn't begin for a few hours."<br><br>"This is a beautiful synagogue."<br><br>"It needs a new roof; the plumbing's shot."<br><br>"What's it called?"<br><br>"The plumbing problem?"<br><br>"No, the synagogue."<br><br>"Benaiah, the Yos� Benaiah Synagogue."<br><br>"Who is Yos� Benaiah?"<br><br>"Third-century Talmudic teacher."<br><br>"I've never heard of him."<br><br>"We only have fragments."<br><br>"Such as?"<br><br>"Tractate <i>Ta'anit</i> 7a: 'If you occupy yourself with Torah for its own sake, your learning will become a source of life.' "<br><br>"Beautiful."<br><br>"My personal favorite is from tractate Baba Batra. It says that once Rabbi Benaiah came upon Abraham's burial cave. There, in front, standing guard, he found Abraham's servant, Eliezer. 'What is Abraham doing?' asked Benaiah. 'He and Sarah are making love,' said the servant."<br><br>"Visiting the caves of people who make love for eternity--an interesting character, this Benaiah guy."<br><br>"Maybe that's why they named the synagogue after him."<br><br>"What a wonderful story. Thank you. Say, you wouldn't by any chance know where I might find some old Kabbalistic books, would you?"<br><br>"Have you looked over there?" The old man gestured toward what looked like a pile of rubbish on a table in a darkened alcove. "Go ahead, help yourself."<br>"But when I walked over to the table," said Kalman, "I saw that it wasn't trash; it was a heap of old Hebrew books. Most of them were in pretty bad condition--individual pages, covers without contents, dozens of damaged prayer books. And that's when I noticed <i>this</i> book. I asked the caretaker if it was for sale."<br>"Doesn't belong to anyone now," he replied. "Go ahead, take it. It's yours. Has your name on it."<br><br>"I couldn't possibly--"<br><br>"Don't be silly. It's been lying there for years waiting for someone like you. If it will make you feel better, you can make a donation." He gestured toward a small wooden box by the door. Carved on it were the customary words <i>A gift given in secret</i>.<br>"I thanked him profusely," Kalman said, "stuffed a twenty-dollar bill into the slot, and walked back outside with the book you are holding."<br><br>The young woman looked at Kalman, then she looked down at the Zohar.<br><br>"Here," said Kalman. "You mentioned earlier that you had an epiphany. Let us learn something together from the Zohar about epiphanies." He opened the book to its first comment on Genesis. "It's a very famous passage; I've studied it many times before. Each time, I get something new."<br>"In the beginning . . ." The beginning of the Holy One's interpretation [of Scripture] was the scoring of a glyph in the supernal purity: a dark spark, a hardened flash of light. It issued from what is beyond comprehension, from the secret of the One without End. . . . Beyond that point, nothing can be known. . . .<br>"That's pretty much how everything begins," Kalman reflected. "You wake up. Before you open your eyes, there is only a mirror-smooth sheet of unconscious ice. And then, from out of that nowhere--and it has to be a nowhere, because there are no coordinates--suddenly a pinprick of light. And the spark does only one thing. It chisels out a single mark, engraves one letter. And--whammo!--the unity is gone. Where once there was One, now there are galaxies and migrating birds, mitochondria swimming in our cellular protoplasm, giant Sequoias, refractor telescopes, that big red neon Tower Records sign down there across the street, and this mug of French roast Starbucks coffee that I picked up this morning on my way here."<br><br>The young woman reached into her bag for a notebook.<br><br>"Relax," said Kalman. "This is not the sort of thing you can or should write down. Trust your ability to absorb what's important. Remember, all the good stuff is already recorded in sacred text anyway."</p><h2>On Augustine</h2><p><p>Since his retirement as Archbishop of Canterbury and his return to academic life (Master of Magdalene College Cambridge) Rowan Williams has demonstrated a massive new surge of intellectual energy. In this new book he turns his attention to St Augustine.</p><p>St Augustine not only shaped the development of Western theology, he also made a major contribution to political theory (<i>City of God</i>) and through his <i>Confessions </i>to the understanding of human psychology. Rowan Williams has an entirely fresh perspective on these matters and the chapter titles in this new book demonstrate this at a glance - 'Language Reality and Desire', 'Politics and the Soul', 'Paradoxes of Self Knowledge', 'Insubstantial Evil'. As with his previous titles, <i>Dostoevsky, The Edge of Words </i>and<i> Faith in the Public Square </i>this new study is sure to be a major contribution on a compelling subject.</p></p><p>Rowan Williams was Professor of Divinity at Oxford before becoming Bishop of Monmouth in 1992. After ten years as Archbishop of Canterbury, he became Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 2013, and is internationally well-known as a theologian, poet and commentator on current affairs.&#x201c;The essays in this excellent book bring Augustine&#x2019;s theology to life so that he becomes a contributor to ongoing theological conversation. This book deserves a wide reading. It will benefit clergy, seminary students, theologians, Augustine scholars, and more. Every seminary and university library should have it.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Anglican Theological Review</i></p><h2>Isabella of France: The Rebel Queen</h2><p>Isabella of France married Edward II in January 1308, and afterwards became one of the most notorious women in English history. In 1325, she was sent to her homeland to negotiate a peace settlement between her husband and her brother Charles IV, king of France. She refused to return. Instead, she began a relationship with her husband&#x2019;s deadliest enemy, the English baron Roger Mortimer. With the king&#x2019;s son and heir, the future Edward III, under their control, the pair led an invasion of England which ultimately resulted in Edward II&#x2019;s forced abdication in January 1327. Isabella and Mortimer ruled England during Edward III&#x2019;s minority until he overthrew them in October 1330. Examining Isabella&#x2019;s life with particular focus on her revolutionary actions in the 1320s, this book corrects the many myths surrounding her and provides a vivid account of this most fascinating and influential of women.</p><p><b>Kathryn Warner</b>'s previous books include <i>Edward II: The Unconventional King </i>and<i> Long Live the King: The Mysterious Tale of Edward II.</i>&nbsp;&#39;An utterly compelling biography, rich in detail, yet in possession of a realistic world view.&#39;--History of Royals Magazine</p><h2>The Philosophy of Freedom: The Basis for a Modern World Conception (CW 4)</h2><p>Written in 1894 (CW 4)<br><br><b>Are we free, whether we know it or not? Is any notion of individual freedom merely an illusion? </b><br><br>Steiner tackles these age-old questions in a new and unique way. He shows that, by considering our own activity of thinking, we can realize the reasons for everything we do. And if these reasons are taken from the realm of our ideals, our actions are free, because only we determine them. <br><br>The question of freedom cannot be settled by philosophical argument. Nor is it simply granted to us. If we want to be free, we must work through our own inner activity to overcome unconscious urges and habitual thinking. To accomplish this, we must reach a point of view that recognizes no limits to knowledge, sees through all illusions, and opens the door to an experience of the reality of the spiritual world.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>animals in translation: using the mysteries of autism to decode animal behaviour</h2><p>&#34;Animals in Translation&#34; is the culmination of Temple Grandin&#39;s extraordinary life&#39;s work, drawing upon the latest research, her distinguished career as an animal scientist and her own experience of being autistic. With co-author Catherine Johnson, Grandin argues that while &#39;normal people&#39; convert experience into words and abstractions, animals and autistics process the world as sensory information - specific pictures, sights and sounds. This difference is the key to understanding how animals see, think and feel. As much a revelation about life with autism as it is about life with animals, &#34;Animals in Translation&#34; explores pain, fear, aggression, love, friendship, communication and learning in a startling book that will change the way you think about animals.</p><p></p><h2>Hawke&#39;s Target (A Sonny Hawke Thriller)</h2><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a term we use in the west,&nbsp;<i>the genuine article</i>, and those words fit Reavis Wortham to a Texas T.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Craig Johnson</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you look for authenticity in your books, you&#x2019;ll swoon over Reavis Wortham.

He took many of the photographs for Abrams' <i>The Fine Art of Flower Arranging, Grounds for Pleasure</i>, and <i>More Decorating with Flowers</i>.This book&#x2019;s novel approach to showcasing international gardens allows the author considerable freedom to display lovely photographs of widely varying scenes, while allowing readers to take each image literally one day at a time. Garden photographer Hales (The Fine Art of Flower Arranging; etc.) shares photos of more than 150 gardens from North America, Europe and Asia. He arranges the gardens alphabetically, from The Abkhazi Garden in Victoria, British Columbia (on January 1), to A Zelun Garden, in Chengdu Province, China (on December 31). Although the gardens don&#x2019;t seem to overtly correspond with the dates, their day by day positioning may help readers appreciate the photographs more slowly and carefully. Some gardens receive numerous pages (for five days in late August, Hales focuses on Portugal&#x2019;s Quinta da Bacalhoa gardens), while others appear only once (such as Jones Wood Garden in New York City and The Elizabeth Lawrence Garden, in Charlotte, North Carolina). Each image appears full-bleed on a right-hand page, and brief commentary accompanies it on the left-hand page. Green thumbs and non-gardeners alike should find enjoyment in these calming, inspiring vistas. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When she is not scraping, painting, glazing, sanding, hammering, or otherwise repairing (or failing to repair!) the old house, she is working on her next Home Repair Is Homicide novel.</p>Chapter 1<br><br>Remove dark stains from wooden floors by dabbing the stained area only with half-strength bleach. Rinse and repeat until the stain is gone, then recolor the lightened spot, if necessary, with wood stain and an artist's brush. --Tiptree's Tips<br><br>HER NAME WAS JACOBIA TIPTREE--JAKE, TO HER FRIENDS--and on that bright day in July twelve years after the Manhattan meeting, she was scraping loose paint off the porch steps of her big old house in Eastport, Maine, when the guy on the bike went by again.<br><br>Or she'd thought the paint would be loose, anyway. But as her son Sam always said, hope springs infernal, and the reality was something else again. Meanwhile:<br><br>Pedaling slowly, looking right at her, the guy on the bike frowned as if he'd just sniffed a spoiled carton of milk. He was decent enough looking otherwise, clean-shaven and neatly dressed.<br><br>But this was his third trip past her home in the last half-hour. And each time he went by, he'd been staring at her in that same unpleasant, almost accusing way.<br><br>Still holding the scraper, she got up, trying to recall where she'd seen his sour expression before. That she had seen it she felt certain, but on somebody else's face.<br><br>A similar face. The guy turned the corner, not looking back. She stood there another moment, wondering. But then with a mental shrug she knelt by the steps once more and returned to work.<br><br>After all, it was nearly the Fourth of July, and the remote island town of Eastport--three hours from Bangor, light-years from anywhere else--was full of tourists. No doubt the bicyclist was one of them, and she really had seen him around, somewhere.<br><br>As for his riding by so often, maybe he liked the house. She had when, upon finding Eastport over a decade ago, she'd fallen instantly in love with the old place. Now from the porch steps she pictured it as she'd first seen it:<br><br>An 1823 white clapboard Federal with three stories plus an attic, it had three red-brick chimneys and forty-eight windows, each with a pair of green shutters. Among its other selling points were a huge yard, a fireplace in every room, and original hardwood floors.<br><br>Unfortunately, it had also been a wreck. Under nearly two hundred years' worth of charm lay nearly as many of neglect; she'd had to get the wiring redone and the chimneys rebuilt, and it had needed painting.<br><br>All of which she'd had done, for an amount slightly less than it would've cost to bulldoze the place and start over. Back then, she'd known no better; nowadays, mostly from necessity, she was a halfway decent home-repair enthusiast.<br><br>But it wasn't only about money. Scrape off enough old paint, patch enough plaster, sand the wood floors and rehabilitate half a hundred antique windows plus shutters, and you too could begin feeling that maybe--just maybe--you'd rehabilitated yourself.<br><br>Too bad the half she was any good at was so rarely the half that needed doing. This time, she'd decided to paint all the parts of the house that she could reach and farm out the high work. The plan had seemed reasonable as she was formulating it.<br><br>But for one thing, the porch was massive. So there was a lot of old paint to scrape off before the new could go on. Also, the peeling bits clung like barnacles. Wielding the tool, she went at them with fresh energy; they hung on for dear life.<br><br>"Grr," she muttered, but they couldn't hear her, and even if they could it would probably only make them more obstinate.<br><br>As she thought this, the guy on the bike appeared again, pedaling along. Dark hair, striped red-and-white polo shirt, blue jeans . . . in his middle twenties, maybe, she thought.<br><br>The bike was a balloon-tired Schwinn from the fleet of them that were available for rent downtown, with a wire basket up front, fake-leather saddlebags, and a bell.<br><br>Brring! She wouldn't have thought a bike bell could be rung threateningly, but he managed it.<br><br>"Hey," she began, taking a step toward the street.<br><br>Climbing sharply from the waterfront, Key Street featured big antique houses fronted by huge maples lining each side. It was the very picture of a traditional Maine coast town's prosperous old residential area. Scowling, the guy stood on the pedals and pumped, speeding away through it.<br><br>Once more she felt she knew him from somewhere. But there wasn't much she could do about it, so when he'd gone she returned to removing a ton of porch paint one stubborn chip at a time.<br><br>Soon a warm, salt breeze, sunshine like pale champagne, and the faint cries of seagulls over the bay had all but erased her memory of the bike guy . . . until, just when she'd really forgotten about him, he came back yet again, half an hour or so later.<br><br>Using a belt sander, she was at last making progress on the job. Under the power tool's howling attack, the paint came off in clouds of sawdust.<br><br>And that was more like it. She'd finished the first step, begun on the second, and shut the sander off to replace a clogged belt when someone behind her cleared his throat meaningfully. On its own, her hand moved to grab the sharp-edged paint scraper.<br><br>"You won't need that." His voice was New York-accented.<br><br>She stood, turned, and took a step toward him, forcing him to move back fast.<br><br>"You're on private property. And I want you to leave now."<br><br>The fellow smiled at her. Not a pleasant smile.<br><br>More like a baring of teeth. "Yeah, I guess you would."<br><br>Close up, he appeared clean and neat, with a careful shave and a recent haircut. "But hey, not everyone gets what they want in this world." The smile slid into a smirk.<br><br>Her heart thumped. "You've mistaken me for someone else." She took another step. "You'll have to go, or I'm going to call the police and let them take care of you."<br><br>At this he let out a laugh of genuine amusement. She was gripping the paint scraper very tightly, she realized.<br><br>" 'Call the police,' " he repeated. "That's a good one."<br><br>"Okay, that's it. I mean it, you need to go."<br><br>She searched her mind for an exit strategy, not wanting to turn her back on him. Besides, the screen door at the top of the steps was locked so the dogs wouldn't barge out through it.<br><br>Oh, the hell with it. Back in Manhattan, half the pedestrians on the sidewalk were pushier than this guy. Scraper in hand, she advanced on him.<br><br>His hands went up in a conciliatory gesture. "Okay, I get the idea. You don't want to hash over old times."<br><br>She followed him to the end of the sidewalk. He got on the bike, rode it in a tight circle, then braked hard, skidding.<br><br>"I guess if I were you, I wouldn't want the past coming back to bite me, either. Not if I'd done what you did."<br><br>Speechless, she could only stare.<br><br>"But it has," he continued. "What'd it say in that famous guy's play? Murder will out?"<br><br>She found her own voice. "You've got the wrong person. Now please take your nonsense and--"<br><br>His hands gripped the handlebars: smooth skin, pristine fingernails. "I know you, though. And what you did. Anyway, you've got until the fourth," he added. "When it's over, you will be, too. Over, that is."<br><br>As he spoke, a little cloud sailed across the sun and the sky darkened suddenly. The breeze stiffened, and all at once the gulls' cries sounded hostile.<br><br>"That play-writing guy had it right," said her unpleasant visitor. " 'Blood shows up again. Murder will out'."<br><br>He began pedaling slowly away. "And now," he called back as she stared after him, "right now, it's here and it's outing you."<br><br>Brrring!<br>She was still shaking when she got inside. Locking the back door, she hurried to the front to be sure the screen really was on the hook.<br><br>It was, and the bicycle guy was nowhere in sight. Her heart hammering, she checked the dogs and found them both asleep in the laundry room, the coolest place in the house.<br><br>Not that they'd have been any help. At thirteen, Monday the black Labrador was too ancient to be roused by much, and Prill the Doberman would be inclined to kiss a burglar to death.<br><br>Meanwhile, her husband, Wade Sorenson, and her grown son, Sam, were out fishing together; her father, Jacob Tiptree, and her stepmother, Bella Diamond, were away for the morning, too.<br><br>So for now she was on her own with this. Whatever this was; maybe nothing. But who was the guy . . . and what could he want?<br><br>Back in Manhattan, it might not've been so strange. Some of her clients there were so crooked that when their sons went to prison, they regarded it as the equivalent of graduate school.<br><br>But eventually she'd wised up, throttled down, and left the city behind, along with an ex-husband so faithless that the only thing she could depend on about him was that she couldn't depend on him.<br><br>By contrast, the old house in Eastport could be depended on for many things: faulty plumbing, a foundation that was fast rotting into the ground, and a bad fuse box, for instance.<br><br>When she moved in, the old plaster was falling down anywhere that the antique wallpaper wasn't holding it up. The floors were indeed lovely, but so uneven they resembled the heaving deck of a storm-tossed ship. The bath was a mildewed horror, the woodwork needed refinishing, and the roof leaked, so the gorgeous old tin ceilings were lacy with rust.<br><br>In other words, the place was exactly like her ex-husband, Victor, only fixable. So naturally she'd fallen for it.<br><br>Now she looked around at the big, bright kitchen with its high, bare windows, pine wainscoting, and scuffed floor. Even as old-fashioned and faintly shabby as it was, due to her stepmother Bella Diamond's efforts the room always glowed as if lit from within by the spirits of Betty Crocker and Holly Homemaker.<br><br>And the old things in it--the soapstone sink, the pass-through to the butler's pantry--just made it more familiar and comforting. But with the arrival of the bike-riding stranger, the past abruptly took on a threatening edge. And what had he meant about her having until the fourth? Had he actually been threatening her?<br><br>At the thought, her whole life here felt suddenly so fragile that it was all she could do not to rush to the cellar for one of the handguns she kept there, locked in a weapons box.<br><br>She knew how to shoot them, too. Half Wade's courtship of her--besides being Eastport's harbor pilot, he was a crack shot and old-weapons expert--had happened on the town's firing range.<br><br>But wanting a gun now was surely overreaction. The guy on the bike was no one to worry about, because real threats didn't advertise, did they? They crept up on you. They--<br><br>The back door opened behind her. But she'd locked it, she had definitely--<br><br>She was halfway to the cellar door, thinking, Key, lockbox, Smith &amp; Wesson .342 Special, when the familiar voice stopped her.<br><br>"Hello? Anyone home?"<br><br>The breath went out of her in a whoosh as she recognized her best friend, Ellie White. "Ellie. I thought you were a--"<br><br>The dogs scrambled from the laundry room. Even Monday, her whitened face sweet with an old-dog smile, could always manage a welcome for Ellie.<br><br>Laughing, Ellie began dispensing dog biscuits, then froze when she caught Jake's look. "Everything okay?"<br><br>Ellie was tall, slender, and redheaded with pale green eyes and freckles like gold dust sprinkled across her nose. Today she wore a white smock, a bright patchwork skirt, and sandals.<br><br>Jake sighed. "You startled me, is all."<br><br>Ellie had house keys. "I knocked," she explained, "but . . ."<br><br>But Jake had been preoccupied. Now she busied herself making coffee, trying to cover the fact that her hands were trembling.<br><br>Ellie wasn't fooled. "Speak," she ordered as the dogs went back to the cool room.<br><br>"It's nothing. Really, I just . . ."<br><br>Since the day they'd met--Jake the newcomer in town, Ellie the native Eastporter--they'd been practically inseparable. Now, without asking, Ellie began making lunch.<br><br>Soon sliced bread, butter, and honey appeared on the table. The coffeemaker burbled comfortingly. Ellie didn't speak until she'd gotten Jake busy with eating and drinking.<br><br>When they'd both finished, Ellie fired up Jake's laptop computer.

In this book, clinical psychologist Stephen Diamond determines where rage and anger originate and explores whether these powerful passions are -- as most people believe -- purely negative, pathological, and evil or can be meaningfully redeemed and rechanneled into constructive activity.

I have always felt that Dr. Diamond's emphasis on the daimonic was extremely timely and important in our day. The myth of the daimonic covers vital, archetypal human experiences, as this work clearly illustrates. I find it very readable, and done like the true scholar." -- from the Foreword by Rollo May<br><br> "An impressive, prodigious work; so comprehensive, so rich, and very creative. This excellent book is unique in making sense of the 'senseless violence' that permeates American society today. When we understand the root causes of the human need for violence, we will be able to make an ally of the energy it liberates." -- June Singer, author of <i>Boundaries of the Soul</i><br><br> "Diamond shows how existential depth psychology can help us understand the anger and violence so rampant in American society. He explains how we are both subject to and responsible for powerful psychic forces active within us, forces which, depending on how we respond to them, can press toward either creative or destructive expressions. Diamond's book is elegantly written, well researched, and clinically well informed. It is an important contribution." -- Michael Washburn, author of <i>The Ego and the Dynamic Ground</i> and <i>Transpersonal Psychology in Psychoanalytic Perspective</i><br><br> "Written with great vigor, clarity, and conviction, this book is fast paced and a pleasure to read." -- George B.

Brimming with creative and political energy, the neighborhood's diverse array of artists and activists took advantage of a brief period of progressivism during the war years to launch a bold cultural offensive aimed at winning democracy for all Americans, regardless of race or gender. Ardent believers in America's promise, these men and women helped to lay the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement before Cold War politics and anti-Communist fervor temporarily froze their dreams at the dawn of the postwar era.<br><br>In <i>Harlem Nocturne</i>, esteemed scholar Farah Jasmine Griffin tells the stories of three black female artists whose creative and political efforts fueled this historic movement for change: choreographer and dancer Pearl Primus, composer and pianist Mary Lou Williams, and novelist Ann Petry. Like many African Americans in the city at the time, these women weren't native New Yorkers, but the metropolis and its vibrant cultural scene gave them the space to flourish and the freedom to express their political concerns. Pearl Primus performed nightly at the legendary Caf� Society, the first racially integrated club in New York, where she d�buted dances of social protest that drew on long-buried African traditions and the dances of former slaves in the South. Williams, meanwhile, was a major figure in the emergence of bebop, collaborating with Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell and premiering her groundbreaking Zodiac Suite at the legendary performance space Town Hall. And Ann Petry conveyed the struggles of working-class black women to a national audience with her acclaimed novel <i>The Street</i>, which sold over a million copies&#x2014;a first for a female African American author.<br><br>A rich biography of three artists and the city that inspired them, <i>Harlem Nocturne</i> captures a period of unprecedented vitality and progress for African Americans and women, revealing a cultural movement and a historical moment whose influence endures today.<br></p><p><b>Farah Jasmine Griffin </b>is the William B.

The Last Time They Met is a singularly ambitious and accomplished work by one of today's most widely celebrated novelists.</strong></p><p><i>The Last Time They Met</i> opens with two old lovers, both poets, running into each other at a writer's conference. Well, Linda Fallon and Thomas Janes aren't old, actually--just middle-aged, with a lifetime's worth of history between them. In the first section, Anita Shreve only suggests what that history contains: there was adultery, we gather, and a car accident, plus some illicit encounters under a pitiless Kenyan sun. Presumably the rest of the book will lead back to the beginnings of this grand passion, right? We think we know where this is going--but that's the tricky part, because we don't.<p> The novel does get off to a slow start, with an unnecessarily drawn-out description of a luxury hotel. But it picks up speed as it moves backward in time, from the lovers' vividly evoked interlude in Africa, to their adolescent years in the Massachusetts village of Hull, and finally to Linda's deepest, darkest secret. Only then does the author unveil her final revelation, which should leave most readers somewhat out of breath, and possibly even obliged to turn back to the first page and read the book over again. Shreve is a canny storyteller, and she knows her characters inside and out. (As well she might: Thomas is the husband of Jean, the photographer in <i>The Weight of Water</i>.) And <i>The Last Time They Met</i> is yet another example of the kind of book she does best--one that's as skillfully plotted as a thriller, but with writing that lingers long after the last plot twist is unfurled. No matter whether people actually <i>have</i> affairs like these.

King came up with a completely original story that had Sherlock Holmes as one of its principal characters but was in no way part of the Holmes canon. The focus of that book was a young woman, Mary Russell. Now in <b>A Monstrous Regiment of Women</b>, Mary Russell's adventures as a student of the famous detective continue. A series of murders claims members of a strange suffrage organization's wealthy young female volunteers, and Mary, with Holmes in the background, investigates, little knowing what danger she personally faces. <p> Laurie R. King is also the author of the Edgar Award-winning novel A Grave Talent.</p>The dawn of 1921 finds Mary Russell, Sherlock Holmes&#39;s brilliant young apprentice, about to come into a considerable inheritance. Nevertheless, she still enjoys her nighttime prowls in disguise through London&#39;s grimy streets, where one night she encounters an old friend, now a charity worker among the poor. Veronica Beaconsfield introduces Russell to the New Temple of God, a curious amalgam of church and feminist movement, led by the enigmatic, electrifying Margery Childe. Part suffragette, part mystic, she lives quite well for a woman of God from supposedly humble origins. Despite herself, Russell is drawn ever deeper into Childe&#39;s circle. When Veronica has a near-fatal accident -- and turns out to be the fourth bluestocking in the group to meet with misadventure after changing her will -- Russell and Holmes launch a quiet investigation. But the Temple may bring the newly rich Russell far closer to heaven than she would like....</p><h2>Gateway to Knowledge: A Condensation of the Tripitaka, Vol. 3</h2><p>The Gateway to Knowledge is a condensation<br>of the Tripitaka and its accompanying commentaries.

It is only when Holmes and Watson travel to the Red Planet, ostensibly to track down the killer of an eminent Martian philosopher, that they learn the truth: the Martians who invaded Earth are tyrannical despots who subjugated a 'lesser' race of their own kind, and are merely biding their time to enslave the citizens of Earth. With the assistance of anti-Martian activist Miss Freya Hadfield-Bell, and a cadre of renegade Martians, Holmes and Watson escape Mars with their lives and return to Earth where they hope to work to overcome the rule of the oppressive Martian overlords.</p><p><b>Eric Brown</b> is a British science fiction author.

"Autumn is beginning to slip out from undercover. I think of this moment as its own distinct time, as Summer Over Autumn. This is the moment that precedes the fall snap, the great colors, and the final bare season in November."Mansfield's new book is about such moments. Summer Over Autumn is a small book of small-town life. He has written twenty-one short essays over the last thirty years, stories about neighbors, animals, tractors, trees, yard sales, funerals, money, and fidelity to time itself. It's a book about the crooked path that is New Hampshire, about the parts that are postcard pretty, and the rougher parts that have a kind of hidden grace you have to live with to really see.He doesn't waste time with the "quaint postcard" view of a New England town, but shows readers where the real merit of small-town life lies. It can be found in the war waged against invasive, wild rosebushes, the hopeful placing of bets in the elm tree lottery, the artful dance of fundraising, and in bribing the band to play longer at the mechanic's anniversary party. He brings us the hidden stories in one chair, a conversation in passing, or a Fourth of July fireworks display. Like Hancock's crooked Main Street, the town and these stories are not just there for reminiscing; they are a "breathing lesson."Howard Mansfield is an everyday tourist and detective of the nearby. His ability to fully immerse himself in the here rather than rushing on towards there, has helped him create the wonderful essays in this small book full of big ideas.</p><p>"A wonderful book. An insightful but droll glimpse inside the life of one New England town. Bringing us the small events and encounters withneighbors and townspeople, Howard goes straight to the heart of theinscrutable nature of small-town life, of New England life.

His curiosity propels every sentence hewrites, no more so than in Summer Over Autumn."<br>-- Mel Allen, editor, <i>Yankee</i> magazine<br><br>"Howard Mansfield truly understands New Hampshire, and he's clearlyat home here. He has a journalist's instinct for digging up a goodstory, an historian's deep knowledge of his subject, an old soul'sinsights into life and a poet's gift for turning a phrase.

He demonstrates that our food choices have enormous and often surprising significance.</p><p>Sidney Mintz, a professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University examines how foods such as sugar, alcohol, chocolate, and tea, once limited to the rich and powerful, became accessible to the general populace, and how companies such as Coca Cola gained international recognition--exporting their products to even the most remote regions of the world. In his final essay, &#34;Eating American,&#34; Mintz discusses the nation&#39;s obsession with fitness and diet and our progressive weight gain. He also provides an apocalyptic view of the future--predicting a doubling of the nation&#39;s population by 2064, and a loss of more than 180 million acres of arable land through erosion and urbanization.Sidney W.

Speeches by John Randolph and Henry Clay capture the political passions of the early republic, while three addresses by Daniel Webster&#x2014;his first Bunker Hill oration, his second reply to Hayne, and his controversial endorsement of the Compromise of 1850&#x2014;demonstrate the eloquence that made him the most renowned orator of his time.<br><br> American speeches by figures that did not hold office are included as well: union leader Ely Moore attacking economic aristocracy; woman&#x2019;s rights speeches by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth; Henry Highland Garnet&#x2019;s incendiary call for slave rebellion; Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s scathing &#x201c;What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?&#x201d; John C.

To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. <br> <br> While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle -- without weapons -- that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. <br> <br> In celebration of the fortieth anniversary of <i>Star Trek</i>, here for the very first time collected together are the spectacular images from the highly successful and acclaimed <i>Star Trek</i>: Ships of the Line calendars.

Being the geek got him noticed, even garnered an eye roll from Coach Hickman, who before Dawson started wearing black on Fridays hadn&#x2019;t bothered to remember Dawson&#x2019;s name.<br><br>At the beginning of the school year, during roll call for history class Coach would yell out &#x201c;Dawson Hayes&#x201d; and look around the entire room, over Dawson&#x2019;s head and sometimes straight at him. When Dawson raised his hand, Coach Hickman&#x2019;s eyebrows would dart up like the man would never in a million years have put a cool name like Dawson Hayes together with the pimpled face and the hesitant, skinny arm claiming it. Dawson didn&#x2019;t mind. He was finally starting to get noticed and it didn&#x2019;t matter how it came about.<br><br>Even now he knew the only reason for his continued invitation to these exclusive retreats in the forest was because Johnny Bosh liked what Dawson brought to the party. Tonight that something was burning a hole in Dawson&#x2019;s jacket pocket. He tried not to think about it. Tried not to think how earlier he had lifted it--that&#x2019;s right, lifted, borrowed, not stolen--from his dad&#x2019;s holster while the man slept on his one night off. His dad probably wouldn&#x2019;t care as soon as he heard Dawson was hanging with Johnny B. Okay, that wasn&#x2019;t true. His dad would be pissed. But wasn&#x2019;t he always encouraging Dawson to make friends, go do stuff that other kids were doing? In other words, be a normal teenager for a change.<br><br>Dawson thought that was part of his problem--he was too normal. He wasn&#x2019;t a superstar athlete like Johnny B or a tobacco-chewing cowboy like Trevor or a brainiac like Kyle, but just holding the Taser X26, with its lightweight, bright-yellow casing that fit perfectly in his hand, gave him a new identity and a sense of confidence. All he had to do was point and wham, there goes fifty thousand volts of electricity. And suddenly Dawson Hayes, the powerless, became powerful. He could control anyone and everyone. With this sleek piece of technology in the palm of his hand Dawson felt like he could do anything.<br><br>Okay, maybe it wasn&#x2019;t just the Taser. Maybe the salvia had a little something to do with it. He&#x2019;d been chewing his wad for about fifteen minutes and he could already feel the effect. That was just one of the highlights of tonight.<br><br>Dawson looked for the camera hidden behind some low sweeping pine branches. Though it remained camouflaged he could see the green dot blinking only because he had helped Johnny set it up earlier, making sure the tripod blended in with the trees. No one else knew it was there. Being the geek in residence did have its advantages.<br><br>Dawson glanced around at the campground. They had stomped out an area for themselves in a secluded part of the pine forest where they probably shouldn&#x2019;t have a frickin&#x2019; campfire. Johnny B said no one could see them from the road or the lookout tower, though it didn&#x2019;t matter. Both would be vacant. On one side was an open field, a swell of tall rolling grass separated by a barbed-wire fence. On the other side was the thick beginning of ponderosa pine. About ten yards away the Dismal River snaked by. Dawson could hear the water tonight, just a whisper running over the rocks.<br><br>They had left their vehicles about a quarter mile down in a deserted turnoff, a two-tire trail worn into the knee-high grass. They had to climb over a barbed-wire fence to enter the forest. The trek was only the first test of the night but Dawson thought it revealed quite a lot about tonight&#x2019;s guests. How they maneuvered and crawled over the sharp barbs showed just how capable they were. Whether they turned to help the next person get over or under the fence or if instead, they looked for assistance. Or worse, expected assistance.<br><br>That was another thing about Dawson that made him different from other kids his age. He liked watching how people reacted to each other, to their surroundings, and especially to the unpredictable. His generation had become mindless zombies, mimicking and copying each other, caught up in their own little worlds of what is rather than what if. That was probably what interested him most about Johnny&#x2019;s experiments.<br><br>There were only seven of them here tonight and yet they still grouped together in their cliques. Johnny was surrounded by the babes, Courtney and Amanda. Tonight even Nikki had inserted herself into the cool clique, which disappointed Dawson. He had hopes that Nikki would be better than that. All three girls looked like they were hanging on every one of Johnny&#x2019;s words, laughing and tossing their hair back then tilting their chins in that way girls do to show their interest.<br><br>That was okay. Johnny was good at looking like it was his club, his party. Quarterback, homecoming king, he was charming but with just enough of a badass attitude that nobody challenged him. Being Johnny&#x2019;s friend was safer than being someone who annoyed him.<br><br>Dawson wasn&#x2019;t quite sure why Johnny wanted the Taser. He didn&#x2019;t need it. Johnny exuded confidence, even in those silly cowboy boots. Kids called him Johnny B and it was the coolest nickname. Dawson had even heard Mr. Bosh call out &#x201c;Johnny be good&#x201d; at one of the football games and then the man laughed like he expected just the opposite from his son and that it was perfectly okay with him.<br><br>The first flash of light came without a sound. Everyone turned but only briefly.<br><br>The second flash crackled overhead. Dawson thought it might be lightning but it blurred into blue and purple veins that spread over the treetops like a crack in the twilight sky.<br><br>Dawson heard &#x201c;oohs&#x201d; and &#x201c;aahs,&#x201d; and smiled to himself. They&#x2019;re tripping out, enjoying the fireworks. He probably was, too.<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t used salvia before but Johnny B said it was better than anything from the family medicine cabinet and way more potent than regular weed. Johnny said it was like &#x201c;rock-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-roll fireworks squeezing your brain, convincing you that you could fly.&#x201d;<br><br>Dawson thought the stuff looked harmless. Green, the color of sage, with wide leaves and similar to something he&#x2019;d find in his mom&#x2019;s old flower beds.<br><br>God, he missed his mom.<br><br>Dawson squashed some more of the plant into a tight wad and stuck it into his mouth between his gum and cheek like chewing tobacco, no longer wincing at the bitter flavor.<br><br>Johnny had called the plant &#x201c;Sally-D&#x201d; and told them that the Indians used it for healing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll clear your sinuses, clean out your guts, soothe your aches, and erase the static in your brain.&#x201d;<br><br>However, he also sounded this excited last week when he had them all snort the OxyContin he&#x2019;d crushed into fine particles. He had been able to confiscate only two of the pills from his mom&#x2019;s medicine cabinet so the effects--when crushed and spread out among a dozen kids--didn&#x2019;t quite live up to Johnny&#x2019;s promises. But here he was, once again, sounding like an infomercial, working his magic and getting them to give the new drug a try in the hopes of feeling good and being cool.<br><br>Less than a minute after Dawson&#x2019;s second hit he felt light-headed, a pleasant mind-tickling buzz that disconnected him from the others as he watched them stumble and laugh and point at the sky. It was like he was watching from another room, in slow motion from a faraway galaxy right outside his bedroom window.<br><br>There was a deep bass rhythm pounding, pounding, pounding at the base of his skull. Tree branches started to sway. Their trunks multiplied, by twos then threes.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when he saw the red eyes.<br><br>They were hidden in the bush, back behind Kyle and Trevor, right behind Amanda.<br><br>Fiery dots watched, darting back and forth.<br><br>How could the others not see this creature?<br><br>Dawson opened his mouth to warn them but no sound came out. He lifted his arm to point but he didn&#x2019;t recognize his hand, yellow and green, almost fluorescent in the flashing strobe light that came out of the treetops. Waves of purple and blue crackled through the branches.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when Dawson first smelled the heat. Almost like someone had left on a hot iron for too long. Then suddenly the smell was stronger, reminding him of scorched hot dogs on an open campfire--black, crispy, burned meat. Then he remembered they hadn&#x2019;t brought any food.<br><br>The sensation started as a tingle. Static electricity traveled the airwaves. The others felt it, too. They weren&#x2019;t &#x201c;oohing&#x201d; and &#x201c;aahing&#x201d; anymore. Instead, they stumbled, heads tilted upward, searching the treetops.<br><br>Dawson looked back at the brush for the fiery red eyes. Gone.<br><br>His head swiveled. He could hear a mechanical click in his head like his eyes had become a machine. Each blink scraped like a camera shutter. Every movement ticked and echoed in his head. His nostrils flared, sucking in air that singed his lungs. A metallic taste stuck in his throat.<br><br>The next flash of light sizzled, leaving a tail of live sparks.<br><br>This time Dawson heard shouts of surprise. Then cries of pain.<br><br>Suddenly the fiery red eyes came running out of the brush, racing straight at Dawson from across the campsite.<br><br>Dawson raised his arm, aimed the Taser, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>The creature reeled back, fell, and sprawled in the leaves, kicking up glowing stars that shot out of a bed of pine needles. Dawson didn&#x2019;t wait for the creature to spring to its haunches. He turned and started running, or at least his legs did. The rest of him felt carried, shoved into the forest by a force stronger than his own feet.<br><br>It was all he could do to raise his arms and protect his face from the branches. They tore at his clothes and slashed his skin. He couldn&#x2019;t see. The pounding at the base of his skull drowned out all other sound. The flashes were hot and bright behind him. In front of him, total dark.<br><br>He hit the wire hard. The jolt of electricity knocked him off his feet. He stumbled and felt his skin pierced and caught like a fish on a thousand hooks. The pain wrapped arrows around his entire body and stabbed him from every direction.<br><br>By the time Dawson Hayes hit the ground, his shirt was slick with blood.<br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>FIVE MILES AWAY<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no blood?&#x201d; Special Agent Maggie O&#x2019;Dell tried not to sound out of breath.<br><br>She was annoyed that she was having trouble keeping up. She was in good shape, a runner, and yet the rolling sand dunes with waves of tall grass made walking feel like treading water. It didn&#x2019;t help matters that her escort was a good ten inches taller than her, his long legs accustomed to the terrain of the Nebraska Sandhills.<br><br>As if reading her mind, State Patrol Investigator Donald Fergussen slowed his pace for her to catch up with him. She thought he was being polite when he stopped, but then Maggie saw the barbed-wire fence that blocked their path. He&#x2019;d been a gentleman the entire trip, annoying Maggie because she had spent the last ten years in the FBI quietly convincing her male counterparts to treat her no differently than they&#x2019;d treat another man.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the strangest thing I&#x2019;ve ever seen,&#x201d; he finally answered when Maggie had almost forgotten she&#x2019;d asked a question. He&#x2019;d been like that on the drive from Scottsbluff, giving each question deliberate consideration then answering with genuine thought. &#x201c;But yeah, no blood at the scene. None at all. It&#x2019;s always that way.&#x201d;<br><br>End of explanation. That had also been his pattern. Not just a man of few words but one who seemed to measure and use words like a commodity.<br><br>He waved his hand at the fence.<br><br>&#x201c;Be careful. It could be hot,&#x201d; he told her, pointing out a thin, almost invisible wire that ran from post to post, about six inches above the top strand of four separate barbed wires.<br><br>&#x201c;Hot?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ranchers sometimes add electric fencing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought this was federal property.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The national forest&#x2019;s been leasing to ranchers since the 1950s. It&#x2019;s actually a good deal for both. Ranchers have fresh pastures and the extra income helps with reforestation. Plus grazing the land prevents grass fires.&#x201d;<br><br>He said all this without conviction, simply as a matter of fact, sounding like a public service announcement. All the while he examined the wire, his eyes following it from post to post as he walked alongside it for several steps. He kept one hand out, palm facing her, warning her to wait as he checked.<br><br>&#x201c;We lost five thousand acres in &#x2019;94. Lightning,&#x201d; he said, his eyes following the wire. &#x201c;Amazing how quickly fire can sweep through the grass out here. Luckily it burned only two hundred acres of pine. That might not mean much somewhere else, but this is the largest hand-planted forest in the world. Twenty thousand of the ninety thousand acres are covered in pine, all in defiance of nature.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie found herself glancing back over her shoulder. Almost a mile away she could see the distinct line where sandhill dunes, covered by patches of tall grass, abruptly ended and the lush green pine forest began. After driving for hours and seeing few trees, it only now occurred to her how odd it was that a national forest even existed here.<br><br>He found something on one of the posts and squatted down until he was eye level with it.<br><br>&#x201c;Most forest services say fire can be good for the land because it rejuvenates the forest,&#x201d; he continued without looking at her, &#x201c;but here, anything destroyed would need to be replanted. That&#x2019;s why the forest even has its own nursery.&#x201d;<br><br>For a man of few words he now seemed to be expending them, but maybe he thought it was important. Maggie didn&#x2019;t mind. He had a gentle, soothing manner and a rich, deep voice that could narrate War and Peace and keep you hanging on his every word.<br><br>At first introductions, he had insisted she call him Donny and she almost laughed. In her mind the name implied a boy. His bulk and weathered face implied just the opposite. His smile did have a boyish quality accompanied by dimples, but the crinkles at his eyes and the gray- peppered hair telegraphed a more seasoned investiga�tor. But then all he had to do was take off his hat&#x2014;like he did now so the tip of his Stetson didn&#x2019;t touch the wire&#x2014;and the cowlick sticking straight up at the beginning of a perfectly combed part brought back the boyish image. <br><br>&#x201c;Ranchers hate fire.&#x201d; Donny paused to take a closer loo...</p><h2>Bob Marley and the Wailers: The Ultimate Illustrated History</h2><p><b>Well over three decades after Marley&#x2019;s death, he and his bandmates remain the most famous reggae artists of all time.&nbsp;<i>Bob Marley and the Wailers</i>&nbsp;explores their legacy.</b><br><br> Illustrated with photos and memorabilia from all phases of their journey, <i>Bob Marley and the Wailers&nbsp;</i>illuminates the <b>lives and times of the man and his collaborators</b>.

The powerhouses Argentina and Brazil alongside tiny Uruguay on one side, and the small but increasingly-powerful Paraguay on the other, fought a conflict that was almost contemporary with the American Civil War and Franco-Prussian War, and rivalled their very high casualty rates. The aftermath of the war saw defeated Paraguay's territory diminished, its total population reduced by a staggering 70 per cent, and its economy ruined for generations, while victorious Brazil was established as the predominant military power on the continent. Despite the extraordinary ferocity of the fighting and the significant historical consequences thereafter, little has been published in English on a war that shaped the political map of Latin America to this day. </p><p>This title book in some crucial gaps by telling the story of the men who fought on both sides, using contemporary paintings, prints, and rare early photographs combined with detailed research and engaging analysis.</p></p><p>Gabriele Esposito is an Italian native, and a long-time student of South American wars.

Yet we see people, such as the Dalai Lama, who have faced circumstances far worse than many of us have faced&#x2014;including exile, persecution, and the loss of many loved ones&#x2014;but who do not burn with rage or seek revenge. How do they do it? <br><br> <i>Working with Anger</i> presents a variety of Buddhist methods for subduing and preventing anger not by changing what is happening, but by framing it differently. No matter what our religion, learning to work with our anger is effective for everyone seeking personal happiness as well as world peace. <br><br> <i>Working with Anger</i> was chosen for a Spirituality and Health Magazine Award as one of the Best Spiritual Books of 2001.</p><p>The following is an excerpt from the chapter of Working with Anger entitled "Mind, Emotions and Anger." <p>One summer His Holiness the Dalai Lama spoke to a Los Angeles audience that included a group of inner city youth in fatigues, their camp uniforms, together with their counselors. After his talk, one of the youths asked His Holiness, "People get right in my face and provoke me. How can I not fight back?" She was challenging him, but quite sincere in her request. </p><p>His Holiness looked her in the eye and said, "Violence is old-fashioned. Anger doesn't get you anywhere. If you can calm your mind and be patient, you will be a wonderful example to those around you." The audience clapped, but the girl remained standing, looking back at him. She wasn't yet satisfied. </p><p>The Dalai Lama went on to describe how so many great people -- Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Jesus, for example -- remained peaceful in the face of violence and adversity. Many of them experienced difficulties when they were growing up. "Even I," he said. "My youth was fraught with conflict and violence. Yet all of these people expounded non-violence and love for others, and the world is better for their contributions. It's possible for you to do this too." </p><p>He then motioned for the girl to come up and shake his hand. As she approached him with her hand outstretched and a nervous smile on her face, the Dalai Lama opened his arms and hugged her. The girl returned to her seat, beaming. </p><p>After the talk, one of the sponsors asked the teenagers if they would share their experience. A burly, tough-looking young man came to the microphone with a huge smile on his face. "Phew," he said, "You must be able to hear my heart beating from where you're sitting! I've seen the Dalai Lama on TV and in the magazines and thought he was pretty cool, but I just can't describe what it feels like to have met him!" and he touched his heart. </p><p>A Tibetan monk who had escaped from Communist-occupied Tibet just a few years earlier told me his story. His family was a wealthy, prominent one in the area of Tibet where he grew up. After the Communist occupation of Tibet in 1950 and the subsequent abortive uprising in 1959, his family's house was confiscated and made into a jail. Because his family were landowners and because he was a monk, he was arrested by the Chinese Communists. Then, he was imprisoned in a jail that had once been his home. He and the other inmates were allowed to go to the toilet outdoors twice a day, but otherwise they had to stay in the house, which now had broken windows and none of its former comforts. Most people would have burned with rage at the injustice and humiliation, but this monk told me that he tried to use his time wisely, doing his meditation practices to improve the state of his mind. Although he was deprived of all his religious implements, he silently recited the texts he had memorized and contemplated their meanings. In this way, he familiarized his mind with attitudes and emotions that lead to enlightenment and avoided the pitfalls of anger. When I talked with him, I detected no sign of resentment against the Chinese Communists. He had a profound love of life. </p><p>Stories such as these lead us to wonder, "How do they do it?" They are human beings just like us, and although they have faced circumstances much worse than a great many of us have faced-including exile, imprisonment, torture, and the loss of many loved ones-they do not burn with rage or seek revenge. This book is largely a collection of Buddhist methods for subduing and preventing anger that have worked for the Dalai Lama, the monk above, and many others. </p><p>There is nothing particularly "Buddhist" about these methods. In fact, many of the Buddha's teachings are common sense, not religious doctrine, and common sense is not the property of any religion. Rather, these methods show us reasonable and beneficial ways to live. No matter what our religion, looking at our minds and learning to work with our anger are helpful.</p>Venerable Thubten Chodron has been a Buddhist nun since 1977 and has studied and practiced Buddhism under the guidance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Tsenzhap Serkong Rinpoche, Lama Zopa Rinpoche and other Tibetan masters.

This expanded edition includes a new preface by the author as well as her post-9/11 "Six Meditations in Place of a Lecture."</p><p>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes two National Book Awards, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant, and a Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.Award-winning poet Rich offers a new volume of collected essays (Blood, Bread, and Poetry, 1986, etc.) that feature her distinct blend of feminist polemics and sharp-sighted analysis of the American condition, spiced with verses from a range of kindred spirits. Poetry is as necessary as food, shelter, education, and other human basics, Rich asserts, exploring the relationship between a poet's social responsibility and the world of experience that provides poetry's raw material. The notion of artist-activists remains primary even as Rich acknowledges that poetry, with limited ``value'' in a market economy as entrenched as ours, has been effectively marginalized. The struggle for political power through poetic expression is an engagement on many fronts, as minority voices speak out along with oppressed women, the poor along with the gay community. Quoting Muriel Rukeyser, June Jordan, and others to emphasize that poetry can convey valuable messages of social redemption, Rich also draws on sources from Trotsky to Wallace Stevens to illustrate her own educational path. Her understanding that racism and sexism are integral parts of the social landscape wasn't attained overnight, and the painful process of emergence from an early life of privileged narrowness into a fuller awareness is recounted at length. The transformative, conjuring power of poetry is reaffirmed throughout, with its potential impact enhanced as it finds its rightful place in the cultural mainstream. Challenging and rewarding as always, although at times the essays serve as little more than venues for the poetry and words of others. In giving access to lesser-known but like-minded writers, Rich has reduced her own presence--a disappointing trade-off. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Using the huge Perc� Rock&#x2014;its impermanence, its slow-motion crumbling, its singular beauty&#x2014;as his central metaphor, Breton considers issues of love and loss, aggression and war, pacifism, feminism and the occult, in a book that is part prose and part poetry, part reality and part dream.</p><p>Translator Zack Rogow won the PEN-Book-of-the-Month Translation Prize for his co-translation of Breton&#x2019;s <i>Earthlight</i>.</p></p><p>Breton is the great French writer, the founder of Surrealism.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Marked Down for Murder (Good Buy Girls)</h2><p><b>By Jenn McKinlay, author of the Library Lover's mysteries and the Cupcake Bakery mysteries, writing as Josie Belle</b><br><br>Between spending Valentine&#x2019;s Day with her sweetheart, Sam, and shopping upcoming Presidents&#x2019; Day sales with the Good Buy Girls, everything is coming up roses and bargains for Maggie Gerber.

Joanne Claramotta and Claire Freemont followed right behind her.</p><p>The four women belonged to a self-titled group called the Good Buy Girls. They were friends who were all about bargain-hunting and thrifting, and since Maggie had opened her shop, it had become the hub of their operation and their unofficial meeting place.</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, she&#x2019;s got another one,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;Looks like someone&#x2019;s got quite the admirer.&#x201d;</p><p>For the past three days, Henry had delivered a single red rose to Maggie Gerber with a card that had one word written on it. Maggie took the rose from Henry and felt her face grow warm. She was embarrassed but also a bit giddy from the attention.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you so much,&#x201d; she said. She tried to offer him a tip, but he waved her away.</p><p>&#x201c;You keep your money, Maggie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been paid more than enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie gave him a chagrined look, and his wrinkled, old face split into a smile that showed off his dentures.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t hold back,&#x201d; Joanne said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the word of the day?&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie put the red rose in a vase with two others and opened the small card. The word <i>You</i> was scrawled in blocky script in a black felt-tip pen. She knew that handwriting. It belonged to her boyfriend, Sam Collins, who happened to be the police chief of their small Virginia town, St. Stanley. Of course, when she had questioned him the previous two days, he had denied all knowledge of any flowers or cards.</p><p>When put together in order, the cards read, <i>Maggie, Will You.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Squee!&#x201d; Joanne let out a squeal. Her long brown ponytail swung back and forth as she bounced up and down on her feet.</p><p>&#x201c;That is just the most romantic gesture ever,&#x201d; Claire sighed. She pushed her black, rectangular glasses up on her nose. &#x201c;I wonder what will be on the next card.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m betting I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow, and every day right up until Valentine&#x2019;s Day.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie and the others waved to him as he left the shop. Ginger turned back to face Maggie and rested her chin on her hand as she leaned on the counter and studied the cards.</p><p>&#x201c;So, what do you think he&#x2019;s going to ask you?&#x201d; Her teeth flashed white against her brown skin and her dark eyes gleamed with delight.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;I keep asking him, but he denies knowing anything about it.&#x201d;</p><p>Ginger&#x2019;s eyebrows rose. &#x201c;Do you think it&#x2019;s someone else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;I recognize the handwriting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t freak out on me,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;But do you think he&#x2019;s going to propose?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;No, no, no.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t beat around the bush,&#x201d; Ginger said. &#x201c;Tell us how you feel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve only been dating for two months, not even, a proposal would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Romantic?&#x201d; Joanne sighed, and the others did, too.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking <i>premature</i>,&#x201d; Maggie said. She frowned at them. &#x201c;Besides, logically speaking, it doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Ginger asked.</p><p>Maggie leaned over the cards, and a hank of her auburn hair fell in front of her face. She tucked it behind her ear as she tapped the counter with her index finger.</p><p>&#x201c;There are three more days to Valentine&#x2019;s day,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So if he did have a rose and a card delivered every day, then a proposal really wouldn&#x2019;t work because, <i>marry</i> and <i>me</i> would only be two more days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unless he&#x2019;s planning something even more spectacular for the next two days,&#x201d; Joanne said. She started jumping up and down again, and Ginger put an arm around her.</p><p>&#x201c;Settle down, girl,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You are going to jiggle that baby right out.&#x201d;</p><p>Joanne instantly put her hands on her belly and her eyes grew wide. &#x201c;You think so?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Ginger said as she gave her a half hug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just teasing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How long now?&#x201d; Claire asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m eight months, give or take a few days,&#x201d; Joanne said. &#x201c;My obstetrician says it could be anytime if baby decides to come early.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A baby,&#x201d; Maggie sighed. &#x201c;It seems like ages since I&#x2019;ve held a wee one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, if this whole card and flower thing does turn out to be a proposal, and you and Sam do get married, will you have another baby?&#x201d; Claire asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. huh?&#x201d; Maggie stammered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I think I just swallowed my tongue.&#x201d;</p><p>Ginger hooted with laughter. &#x201c;You could, you know. You&#x2019;re only forty-one. Why, there are women having babies well into their fifties now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But then I&#x2019;d be in my sixties by the time it went to college,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;And given that I already have a daughter in college, I don&#x2019;t really want to do that again. The financial aid forms alone are a solid case for birth control.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re a very young forty-one. I mean, how many people think your grandnephew, Josh, is your son?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A fair few,&#x201d; Maggie admitted.</p><p>Maggie watched her niece&#x2019;s three-year-old often, and while she loved him dearly, he was another reason she knew she was done bearing children. After an afternoon spent with her Josh-by-gosh, she was exhausted.</p><p>&#x201c;See? You&#x2019;re still young enough,&#x201d; Joanne said. &#x201c;Just think, our babies could play together. We could have mommy-and-me time together, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aw,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;That would be so cute. You could put them in matching outfits and have teddy bear picnics and tea parties. Adorable!&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie frowned at Claire. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you start. You&#x2019;re younger than me. You and Pete could get married and have kids, too, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire shook her head. &#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s not in the cards for me. I realized long ago that I was not mother material. I never even babysat when I was a teen, because the sound of a baby crying gives me hives. There&#x2019;s a reason I&#x2019;m an adult services librarian and not a children&#x2019;s librarian, you know. My cat, Mr. Tumnus, is all the dependent I can handle, thank you very much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is Pete okay with that?&#x201d; Joanne asked. &#x201c;I mean, doesn&#x2019;t he want to have a family of his own?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thankfully, no,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;We had a long frank talk when we first started dating, and we both decided that parenting was not our calling, so it looks like it&#x2019;s all on Maggie and you&#x2014;unless, of course, Ginger wants to try again for a girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lord-a-mercy, no,&#x201d; Ginger said. &#x201c;Four boys are all I can handle. Besides, after Dante came along, I had them take out all of my plumbing since it had begun to collapse. So it&#x2019;s just Maggie then.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie put a hand to her forehead as a sudden attack of wooziness hit her like a freight train. Did Sam want kids? She had no idea. They&#x2019;d never discussed it. What if he wanted to be a dad? What if he wanted more than one? Oh, man, how had this topic of conversation never come up?</p><p>The bells on the front door jangled and Maggie glanced up, willing someone, anyone, to arrive and save her from this discussion.</p><p>The woman who arrived was not her first or even her last pick, but times being desperate, she decided not to quibble.</p><p>&#x201c;Summer Phillips,&#x201d; Maggie cried. She came around the counter and greeted the woman who had been her lifelong nemesis with a wide, warm smile. &#x201c;Come in. How are you, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>Summer froze in mid-step. She looked at Maggie as if she was worried that she was ill with something that could be contagious or deadly or both.</p><p>&#x201c;You look deranged,&#x201d; Summer said in her usual abrasive tone. She tossed her long, bottle-bleached hair over her shoulder and held up a well-manicured hand to ward Maggie off. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to hug me, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Maggie protested. Although she was grateful enough for the interruption that she might give her a half hug or an air kiss. The sour look on Summer&#x2019;s face checked that impulse.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; Summer asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Maggie lied.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s panicking,&#x201d; Ginger whispered to Claire in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone. Maggie heard them all giggle.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just being neighborly. What can I do for you, Summer?&#x201d; Maggie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Summer said. &#x201c;Believe me, I don&#x2019;t want anything from you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why are you in my shop?&#x201d; Maggie asked. &#x201c;You have your own consignment store across the street. Why are you visiting mine?&#x201d;</p><p>A woman nudged her way into the shop behind Summer. She had the same pretty face as Summer, with an upturned nose and prominent cheekbones, but she was obviously older, with very fine lines around her eyes and mouth. Her hair was cut in a black bob, and it swung about her face in graceful sweeps as she looked Maggie over, from head to toe.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, this is Maggie Gerber,&#x201d; Summer said. She stood aside and crossed her arms over her chest. &#x201c;Now that you&#x2019;ve met her, can we please go? This shop gives me the heebie-jeebies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mother?&#x201d; Maggie asked. She blinked. It wasn&#x2019;t like she thought Summer had been spawned from a pinecone; still, she hadn&#x2019;t seen Summer&#x2019;s mother in ages.</p><p>Maggie glanced at the woman still scrutinizing her. Yes, she vaguely remembered Summer&#x2019;s mother, Blair Phillips, from their high school days, but she knew Blair had been married at least three times since then, and she had no idea what her surname was now.</p><p>Blair&#x2019;s lips pursed to the side in a scowl, and her eyes narrowed. Then she shook her head. &#x201c;No, no, I refuse to believe it. There is absolutely no way that Sam Collins threw you over for this.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Maggie asked. She frowned at the woman in front of her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure my boyfriend didn&#x2019;t throw over anyone, especially not her, for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one asked you,&#x201d; Blair said.</p><p>Maggie glanced back at her friends to see if this was for real. Judging by the matching looks of irritation on their faces&#x2014;yep, this was real.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, unless you&#x2019;re here to shop or to consign something for me to sell, you&#x2019;re going to need to leave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now.&#x201d; Maggie was pleased that her voice sounded so calm when on the inside she was boiling.</p><p>Blair glanced around the shop. Her nose crinkled in distaste. &#x201c;No, I really don&#x2019;t see anything in here that would interest me. I don&#x2019;t do the shabby-chic thing that you&#x2019;ve got going on.&#x201d;</p><p>The front door opened and in strode a gray-haired man wearing a plaid shirt and jeans with a scuffed pair of cowboy boots. His wide leather belt seemed to prop up the beer belly he was sporting, but his smile seemed genuine as he took in all of the ladies before him.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I might have known you two girls would be off shopping the first chance you got,&#x201d; he said. His voice had a light drawl to it, but Maggie couldn&#x2019;t tell if it was age or origin that flavored his speech.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no, we&#x2019;re not shopping,&#x201d; Blair corrected him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re merely checking out the competition&#x2014;and we&#x2019;re being very generous by calling it that, believe me.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie supposed she should consider it a compliment that Summer and her mother found her and her shop wanting, but truly it felt like a slam&#x2014;a well-delivered one, at that.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Mr. Blair,&#x201d; the man joked.</p><p>He extended his hand to Maggie. Maggie and the others just stared at him, and he sighed, as if realizing that his wife had made his joke not funny.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Bruce Cassidy, husband to Blair and stepfather to Summer,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Good manners propelled Maggie forward, and she shook his hand. &#x201c;Maggie Gerber. Nice to meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>The others followed her lead, while Blair and Summer frantically whispered behind their hands.</p><p>Maggie was pretty sure they were shredding her shop, her hair and the outfit she wore today. She glanced down, trying not to appear self-conscious. She was wearing her favorite jeans&#x2014;no, not skinny jeans, but the cut and fit were flattering&#x2014;with a snug blue sweater. Possibly they were finding fault with her navy Converse sneakers, but today was the day she sorted inventory in her stockroom, and a skirt and blouse combo really didn&#x2019;t cut it for the heavy lifting.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re done here, Bruce,&#x201d; Blair declared. She strode to the door in her tight skirt and calf-hugging boots topped by her puffy jacket. Summer fell into step behind her, and it was then that Maggie realized the two women were wearing the exact same outfit but in different colors. Blair favored dark jewel tones, while Summer was all about the pastel, shiny fabrics. Neither Blair nor Summer bothered to say good-bye when they left.</p><p>Bruce gave Maggie and the others a shrug as if this were normal operating procedure.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve only been married two years, but she still keeps me on my toes,&#x201d; Bruce said. He smiled, but no one returned it. He tightened his scarf around his neck. &#x201c;Ten years away from southern California and I&#x2019;m still not used to the cold. Well, nice meeting you, ladies.&#x201d;</p><p>He caught the door before it shut completely and pushed his way out onto the street behind Summer and her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;Heaven help us, there are two of them,&#x201d; Ginger said. She stood gaping at the window as if she couldn&#x2019;t believe her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I think I need to find a happy place,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;A very happy place.&#x201d;</p><p>She closed her eyes and concentrated on the Presidents&#x2019; Day sales that would be coming up in a matter of days. Sure enough, thinking about all of the boots, coats, gloves and hats that were to be discounted on the big sale day helped pull her out of her spiral of outrage, hurt, horror and revulsion. Summer and her mother could not touch her in her happy sale place.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you all right in there?&#x201d; Ginger asked after a few minutes. When Maggie didn&#x2019;t answer, she asked, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not catatonic, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie blinked her eyes open. &#x201c;Just mentally perusing the Presidents&#x2019; Day sales.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire, Joanne and Ginger all nodded in perfect understanding. Oh, yes, there was nothing a bargain hunter loved quite so much as a holiday sale.</p><p>&#x201c;I refuse to let Summer or her mother ruin one of the best shopping weekends of the winter for me,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been tracking the Sunday circulars, and the big stores are having mega sales. I&#x2019;m pretty sure I can load up on items to stock the shop for next winter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll help,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;I saw Stegner&#x2019;s is having a buy two get one free on shoes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;And this time, I want to branch out to handbags.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now you are speaking my language!&#x201d; Ginger cried. She was known for her weakness for purses.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking I could do a display of handbags in the window,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;Too bad Laura isn&#x2019;t here. She&#x2019;s so clever with window displays.&#x201d;</p><p>Laura Gerber, Maggie&#x2019;s only child, was away at college in Pennsylvania.

For some it represents a blood sacrifice without the hope&#x2014;or even the intention�&#x2014;of success. For others, it was the first act in a tumultuous political drama played out in Dublin streets and London cabinet rooms that led to the eventual formation of an independent Irish state.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>1916</i>, Kieran Allen argues that this pivotal moment in Irish history has been obscured by those who see it only as a prelude for a war of independence. Emphasizing an often ignored social and political radicalism at the heart of the rebellion, he shows that it gave birth to a revolutionary tradition that continues to haunt the Irish elite. Socialist aspirations mixed, and sometimes clashed, with the republican current, but both were crushed in a counterrevolution that accompanied the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921. The result today is a partitioned Ireland that acts as a neoliberal tax haven for multinational corporations&#x2014;a state of affairs quite alien to both Connolly&#x2019;s and Pearse&#x2019;s vision.<br> &nbsp;<br> Published to coincide with the Rising&#x2019;s centennial, <i>1916: Ireland&#x2019;s Revolutionary Tradition</i> re-establishes the political role of socialist republican figures, offers a highly accessible history of the Easter Rising, and explores the militancy and radicalism that continues to haunt the Irish elite one hundred years later.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Kieran Allen</b> is a sociology lecturer at University College Dublin. His books include <i>Marx and the Alternative to Capitalism</i> and <i>Max Weber: A Critical Introduction</i>, both published by Pluto Press.<br>"The Easter Rising has been widely mythologised as a handful of visionaries giving their lives to rouse a slumbering nation. But it also represented the ripening of deep-seated contradictions within Irish society. Allen has provided a vivid and vital account of how class shaped the national movement which arose in the wake of the Rising &#x2013; and thus shaped the Ireland we live in today."

More than a decade later tempers flared over stolen hogs. This accusation triggered years of bloody violence and retribution that led to a tragic <i>Romeo-and-Juliet</i> interlude, a Supreme Court ruling, and a public hanging. The final feud trial took place in 1898, but the rivalry didn't end there. Its legend continues to have an enormous impact on the popular imagination and the people of the region. Here is a fascinating new look at the infamous story of the Hatfields and the McCoys.</p><p>America&#x2019;s most notorious family feud began in 1865 with the murder of a Union McCoy soldier by a Confederate relative of &#x201c;Devil Anse&#x201d; Hatfield. More than a decade later, Ranel McCoy accused a Hatfield of stealing one of his hogs, triggering years of violence and retribution, including a Romeo-and-Juliet interlude that eventually led to the death of one of McCoy&#x2019;s daughters. In a drunken brawl, three of McCoy&#x2019;s sons killed Devil Anse Hatfield&#x2019;s younger brother. Exacting vigilante revenge, a group of Hatfields tied them up and shot them dead. McCoy posses hijacked part of the Hatfield firing squad across state lines to stand trial, while those still free burned down Ranel McCoy&#x2019;s cabin and shot two more of his children in a botched attempt to suppress the posses. Legal wrangling ensued until the US Supreme Court ruled that Kentucky could try the captured West Virginian Hatfields. Seven went to prison, and one, mentally disabled, yelled, &#x201c;The Hatfields made me do it!&#x201d; as he was hanged in the Bluegrass State&#x2019;s last public execution. But the feud didn&#x2019;t end there. Its legend continues to have an enormous impact on the popular imagination and to exact an onerous toll on the region itself. <br>With a charming voice, a wonderfully dry sense of humor, and an abiding gift for spinning a yarn, best-selling author Lisa Alther makes an impartial, comprehensive, and compelling investigation of what actually happened, masterfully setting the feud in its historical and cultural contexts, digging deep into the many causes and explanations of the fighting, and revealing surprising alliances and entanglements. Here is a fascinating new look at the infamous Hatfield-McCoy feud.Praise for Lisa Alther's KINFOLKS:"Alther's voice is clear and purposeful...often tinged with an engaging, dry sense of humor... &nbsp;Alther weaves her search in a manner that makes readers wish she had written the history books we all read as children." -- Appalachian Heritage Review"Alther employs her considerable narrative skills and well-developed knack for humor in...a thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile read." -- Journal of Southern History"Filled with good humor, fine storytelling, and acute observations of small town life...Anyone who enjoys the humor and turn of phrase of Bill Bryson, Garrison Keillor, or Jean Shepherd should enjoy KINFOLKS." -- Lodi News-Sentinel"A fun read lightened by quirky characters and surprising insights...A unique journey through Appalachia and beyond." -- Mountain Xpress"Compelling bits of history, raucous wit, genealogical sleuthing, and charming childhood memories...With equal parts humor, wonder, and investigative journalism, Alther takes the reader on a journey from eastern Tennessee through the wilds of genealogy...Her discoveries are as revealing as much as they are hidden history." -- Wellesley Magazine"A wise, funny inquiry into the complexities of inheritance...Drolly hilarious and incisive."-- Booklist (starred review)&nbsp;"Lively, engaging...Part genealogical mystery tour and part anthropological exploration...The journey is a delight, full of Alther's arch observations." -- Library Journal&nbsp;</p><h2>The Federal Vision</h2><p>In this stimulating study, several of today&#x2019;'s most provocative Reformed theologians combine efforts to work toward a better understanding of the Covenant. <p>Steve Wilkins writes, "Covenant is the central teaching of the Word of God; it describes a relationship with the Triune God through Jesus Christ, His only Begotten Son. To be in covenant is to be in real communion with God, attendant with real privileges and real blessings. It is to be brought into the circle of the eternal fellowship that has always existed between Father, Son, and Spirit. It is to be made partaker of the divine nature. It is to be beloved of the Father for the sake of His Son and is founded upon union with Christ." </p><p>The Federal Vision communicates the importance of applying a more robust Covenant theology to our study of the relationship between obedience and faith, and to the role of the Church and Sacraments in our Salvation.</p><p>Contributing authors: Steve Wilkins, John Barach, Rich Lusk, Doug Wilson, Steve Schlissel, Peter Leithart, James B.

He became the richest man in TV, befriended everyone in media who mattered, bought a casino, and maintained a secret life as America&#39;s most famously closeted homosexual. From a controversial writer whose previous work has virtually re-defined the art of the celebrity biography, HERE&#39;S MERV.</p><p>Bland, jolly, and innocuous, Merv Griffin was a diplomatic schmoozer whose broadcasted image appeared as a regular guest in our living rooms, kitchens, and bedrooms, oozing affability and setting a standard for the way we wanted to be. Even during Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and the impeachment of Richard Nixon, Merv rarely, if ever, veered from the network's concept of daytime TV as detached escapist fun for the whole family. <p>At least some of those presuppositions have been shredded thanks to the release of Darwin Porter's newest overview of the famously famous and spectacularly wealthy. </p><p>Porter provides a rich feast of guilty pleasures: Show-biz history, in the words of an earlier reviewer, that's "writ large, smart, and with great style." </p><p>It addresses more than "Merely Merv," a subject which in the hands of a lesser writer could have been as dull and prosaic as some of Merv's telecasts. Merv is merely the departure point for an overview of show-biz in the '50s, the raw ambition, the hush-a-by scandals, and the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that, 'till now, were either too controversial or too libelous to actually make it into print. </p><p>The author first met his subject in 1959 when Darwin (then the 21-year-old head of the Student Press at the University of Miami) hired Merv (then a 34-year-old boy singer with a Big Band) to provide the entertainment for his graduating class's senior prom for a fee of $500. </p><p>Based on the friendship that evolved from that event, Porter began the relentless compilation of data which made its way into this book. </p><p>And what a book it is. No one ever defined Merv as celibate, but even by the standards of TV Land, Merv was more promiscuous and more eccentric than anyone outside the entertainment industry could have imagined at the time. En route, he virtually rewrote the rules of television broadcasting, invented the game show as we know it today, racheted up the razzmatazz quotient of casinos around the world, and befriended everyone who mattered in politics and entertainment. </p><p>Born in San Mateo, California in 1925 to bankrupted Irish-American parents, he died a self-made billionaire in 2007 surrounded by friends, family and a public legacy that was one of the most immediately recognizable in America. </p><p>Oh, and in case you didn't know it already, Merv was gay. Promiscuously gay and (offscreen) flamboyantly gay, with a sexual history that included most of the "pretty boys" of super-agent Henry Willson's stable (i.e, Rock, Tab, Guy Madison, and Rory), virtually any male associated with either Liberace or George Cukor, and an uninterrupted string of bronzed actors, models, entertainment-industry wannabes, and porn stars, including gay porno mega-star Cal Culver (aka Casey Donovan. </p><p>As startling as these revelations are (how the studios managed to pull the wool over our eyes back then!), the news, as revealed in Porter's biography, isn't the rather pedestrian fact that Merv liked guys. Described in well-documented detail are young Merv's involvements with an archbishop, scores of A-list actors and actresses, various captains of industry, and politicians who included Eisenhower, JFK, Nixon, The Fords, and the Reagans. </p><p>Of special interest is Merv's involvement in the Alzheimer-derived incapacity of former president Ronald Reagan, as supervised by former pinup girl and starlet, First Lady Nancy (Davis) Reagan. </p><p>Porter handles Merv's penchant for successful schmoozing, both in and out of the boudoir, with tact, respect, and a gift for delivering punchy, well-researched anecdotes about show-biz. </p><p>Author and social critic Larry Post described Merv's predicament like this: "The real irony [of the Herculean efforts Merv took to conceal his gender preference] involves the enduring power of the Hollywood closet that held even a billionaire locked in its embrace, paying homage to the presumed prejudices of the public." </p><p>Although the behavior laid out within Porter's texts might be raunchier and more lurid than what we might have expected from congenial Uncle Merv, it's undoubtedly the kind of book which, after everybody in Hollywood reads it, blogs it, dissects it, and in some cases, becomes apoplectic over it, will be defined as an indispensible guide to the evolution of a uniquely American art form: Merv Griffin.</p>An Irish-American from California, Merv Griffin (1925-2007) evolved into TVs most powerful and richest mogul, earning 17 Emmy Awards for his Merv Griffin Show, a durable daytime staple which attracted 20 million viewers daily. He developed a reputation for interviewing "everybody who mattered" in contemporary American life, breaking social barriers and airing interviews with everyone from Martin Luther King, Jr (his first major TV appearance) to Joan Crawford (one of her last). He also brought on drag queens, revolutionaries, gay activists, and "fringe elements" of the society in ways which at the time were considered radical. Referring to whom he had interviewed during his long career, Merv, with his trademark merriness said, "The only person who ever eluded me was The Pope." <p>Behind the scenes, Merv became quietly known for his Midas touch, developing two of Hollywood's most popular game shows, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. In one now-legendary 15-minutes, he wrote "Think," a melody which played while the contestants were puzzling the questions. He earned $85 million in royalties from that song alone, plus countless additional millions for other television innovations. </p><p>A boy singer with Freddy Martin's band in the 40s, Merv failed at a movie career in Hollywood during the 50s, and bombed in the development of many other TV shows until he got it right. When he did, he justifiably earned a reputation as one of the most loved, most reliable, and most consistent of TV personalities. Flush with millions, Merv later became a major player in the resort and gambling business, locking horns with, among others, Donald Trump. </p><p>Behind the scenes, a radically different man emerged. He married only once in his life, producing a son, but with the notable exception of sexual encounters with Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe, he had almost no affairs with women. His romantic interests lay elsewhere, as he learned one night as a teenager when he seduced his uncle's best friend and Merv's swashbuckling screen hero, Errol Flynn. From that lofty introduction to the world of intra-male sex, a young, thin, and handsome Merv went on to involvements with heartthrobs Guy Madison, Montgomery Clift, Rock Hudson, Marlon Brando, and Roddy McDowall. </p><p>As he matured, put on weight, and accumulated more extensive assets to protect, he often appeared in public with his friend and "arm candy," the glamorous Eva Gabor. But in private, Merv and his best friend, Liberace, systematically seduced, usually for pay, some of the most famous and alluring men in America--models, porno stars, bodybuilders, swimmers, surfers, and, of course, actors. Often, Liberace "traded" boyfriends, as well as career advice, with Merv. </p><p>Despite, or perhaps because of, Merv's secret life, Merv regularly hung out with the very rich and the very famous. He knew them all: Mae West, Bette Davis, Tallulah Bankhead, John and Jackie Kennedy, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Hayworth, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Bob Hope, Dwight Eisenhower, Truman Capote, Gary Cooper, and Richard Nixon. And with the notable exception of Ike, who didn't gossip, he swapped stories, advice, and gossip with each of them. Merv "dated" Elizabeth Taylor and became the best friend of Nancy Reagan. "He was my rock during Ronnie's last years," Nancy told the press after Merv's death (from prostate cancer) in August of 2007. "I can't stand the thought of losing him." Insights into Merv's encounters with these personalities, both onscreen and off, are scattered throughout this biography, which took decades to compile. </p><p>Merv Griffin, A Life in the Closet goes backstage, behind the curtains, to explore the private life of this fascinating personality who was adored by millions of fans. Most of them knew nothing about the private life of the man who became one of the most electrifying personalities on TV, largely because of his laid-back sincerity and in some cases, "Aw, shucks" folksiness. </p><p>And whereas he grew adept at getting the world's most famous people to spill their secrets on TV, he managed to keep the door of his own closet of secrets tightly locked.

From banquets in twelfth-century China to the medicinal roots of French restaurants, the origins of restaurants are not singular&#x2014;nor is the history this book tells. Katie Rawson and Elliott Shore highlight stories across time and place, including how chifa restaurants emerged from the migration of Chinese workers and their marriage to Peruvian businesswomen in nineteenth-century Peru; how Alexander Soyer transformed kitchen chemistry by popularizing the gas stove, pre-dating the pyrotechnics of molecular gastronomy by a century; and how Harvey Girls dispelled the ill repute of waiting tables, making rich lives for themselves across the American West. From restaurant architecture to technological developments, staffing and organization, tipping and waiting table, ethnic cuisines, and slow and fast foods, this delectably illustrated and profoundly informed and entertaining history takes us from the world&#x2019;s first restaurants in Kaifeng, China, to the latest high-end dining experiences.</p><p><b>Katie Rawson</b> is director of learning innovation at the University of Pennsylvania. She writes on food history. <b>Elliott Shore</b> is professor emeritus of history at Bryn Mawr College. He has written on the history of restaurants, advertising, and German America.&#x201c;Unlike many books that delve into the history of restaurants and begin with France (or wayside taverns elsewhere), the academics who have written <i>Dining Out</i>, a compelling volume, start in the Bronze Age. Their definition of a restaurant is elastic, referring to places where strangers might have gathered to eat and drink, including the symposiums of ancient Greece. Long before social upheavals gave rise to the modern restaurant in France, there were what we would consider to be restaurants in twelfth-century China; the authors cite a traveler&#x2019;s memoir of a huge dumpling house with more than fifty ovens. (The influence of Chinese restaurants globally is significant.) The book discusses the economic and technological evolution of restaurants; restaurant service and hierarchy; tipping; the influence of transportation; sexism; chain restaurants; and food writing up to the present day.&#x201d; (Florence Fabricant <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This book is for the dedicated foodie, a comprehensive social history of eating out, from the bronze age to modern times. There&#x2019;s much to nibble on: for example, the word &#x2018;restaurant&#x2019; was originally a popular restorative broth sold in France in the 1700s. By the 1780s it had morphed into what we now understand as a restaurant. There are about 150 photographs, about half in color, and the authors include interesting archival excerpts from journals, documents, and literature.&#x201d; (Sarah Murdoch <i>Toronto Star</i>)<br><br>"As the world economy grew more complex and specialized, workers&#x2019; enhanced mobility gave them time, money, and need to dine out. What sets Rawson and Shore&#x2019;s contribution apart from other histories of restaurant culture is their insight into not simply European restaurants, but their even more ancient Asian counterparts. Appearing in China in the twelfth century, restaurants developed at a time when Chinese cities held three times the population of European capitals. Expansion of trade routes meant that businesspeople ended workdays far from home, and travelers from Sichuan yearned for familiar food even in northern provinces. Japan inaugurated ritualized, sophisticated food service, and women waited tables long before Harvey Girls appeared on the American frontier. Today&#x2019;s foodies may be surprised to discover that farm-to-table cuisine appeared as early as nineteenth-century Manhattan, when Delmonico&#x2019;s started its own Brooklyn farm to supply fresh produce. America&#x2019;s burgeoning cities introduced an astonishing culinary range of ethnic foods, experimental chefs, and today&#x2019;s ubiquity of fast food.

(Paul Freedman, Chester D. Tripp Professor of History, Yale University)<br><br>&#x201c;Rawson and Shore offer a tantalizing trip through the history of eating out from the first restaurants up to today. We meet the restaurant as a place that bristles with innovation, as an institution that has fundamentally altered the ways in which food is prepared, served, and consumed, and one that has itself undergone profound social transformations&#x2014;in the kitchen staff, the service personnel, and the diners.

It had been over twenty years since she'd driven this long stretch of South Carolina highway toward the sea. Growing up, she'd always considered it someplace to drive through on her way to somewhere else. Anywhere else.<br><br>She passed vanishing woodlands and acres of farmland for sale, huge, flat-roofed warehouses and sun-faded billboards heralding exits for boiled peanuts, tree-ripened peaches, stock-car racing and fireworks. It was late May. Spring was already giving way to sizzling summer in the South. Elderberry bushes rambled along the roadsides, and beyond in the pinewoods, Cara knew the coral beans were aflame and swamp roses decorated the banks like some wild hothouse garden.<br><br>The thought that the sea turtles were returning home to nest sprang to mind. She laughed out loud at the irony.<br><br>If someone had told her a year ago that the following May she would be driving to Charleston for an extended visit with her mother, Cara would have tossed back her head and laughed in that throaty manner of hers. "Impossible," she would have told them, the smile slipping from her face and a flash sparking in her eyes. First of all, her schedule would never have allowed it. Every minute of her day was double booked. At best, in an emergency, she might fly in for an overnight stop, as she had for her father's funeral. Secondly, there was nowhere on earth she'd least want to visit than Charleston. And no person less than her mother.

We've always had the best times there, haven't we?<br><br>Please don't say that you are too busy or that you can't get away. Remember how we used to say "Take charge of your birthday"? Can't you grant yourself this one gift of time and spend a few days with your ancient mother? Please come home, Cara dear. Soon. Your father is gone and we need to sort through years of accumulation.<br><br>Love, Mama</em><br><br>Perhaps it was the scent of the gardenias that prompted the sudden loneliness, or simply that someone had remembered her birthday. Or perhaps it was her desolation at having just lost her job. But for the first time since leaving her embrace at eighteen, Cara felt a sudden, desperate longing for her mother.<br><br>She wanted to go home. Home to the Lowcountry, where once she had been happy.<br><br>Cara crossed the Ashley and the Wando rivers, took a final turn off the highway, then sped over a new, graceful arch of roadway that connected the mainland to the small barrier island called Isle of Palms. The vista yawned open before her, revealing a breathtaking view of endless blue sky and watery, greening marsh stretched out as far as she could see. She felt her mind ease as she took in the wide-open space. The hustle and honking of the crowded roads felt a world behind her. Ahead, cutting a wide, blue path through the waving grasses, was the sparkling Intracoastal Waterway and parallel to it, the smaller Hamlin Creek lined with docks, one after another, most with a boat at moor. She reached the peak of the arch.<br><br>Suddenly, looming straight ahead, like a magnificent yet serene beast, lay the vast, glistening expanse of blue that was the Atlantic Ocean. It was a living thing, pulsating power beneath the quiescent surface. Her breath caught, her body shivered and in that soul-striking instant, Cara knew that saltwater still ran thick in her veins.<br><br>She was back on the Isle of Palms. Even the name was soft on the tongue and evoked images of waving palm trees and tranquil, sunny afternoons by the rolling surf. For a hundred years, the Isle of Palms was a place the folks of Charleston and Columbia escaped to when the summers got too beastly hot. They took the ferryboat over to camp in the pine and oak forests or dance at the pavilion to big-name bands. Years later, bridges and roads were built and each summer the island's population swelled along with the heat. Growing up, Cara had spent summer after summer here with her mother and her older brother, Palmer. Her happiest memories were of the three of them living without paying mind to a clock, letting the sultry light of the Carolina sun dictate their days.<br><br>She'd heard that back in 1989 Hurricane Hugo had turned the island upside down. But she hadn't imagined the extent that time could alter a landscape. This used to be a sleepy island town with a grocer, liquor and hardware store clustered together beside a small stretch of postcardish, islandy restaurants. Ocean Boulevard was but a line of modest beach cottages across from a wide stretch of sand dunes that rolled lazily along the ocean.<br><br>So it was all the more shocking to see that the dunes she'd played on were gone, paved flat for a row of mansions that formed a wall of pastel-colored wood blocking the view of the sea and dwarfing the once oceanfront cottages across the street. These beautiful new post-Hugo houses stood even closer to the water's edge, as though arrogantly daring the heavens to strike again. Cara could turn her head left, then right as she drove and see, in turn, an eerie picture of pre-and post-Hugo worlds.<br><br>Still, some things never changed, she thought as she spied a line of pelicans flying overhead looking like a squadron of bombardiers on patrol. She opened her window to the balmy island air and breathed deeply. Dusk was setting in, and with each moist breeze she felt a page of her history flutter back, recalling the days when she was young and pedaled this road on her bicycle, feeling the wind toss her hair like streamers behind her. She drove another two blocks south, scanning. Her breath caught in her throat when she saw it.<br><br>Primrose Cottage. As pale a yellow as the delicate evening primroses that surrounded it, the 1930s beach cottage sat back from the road perched on a small dune. In contrast to all the meticulously landscaped properties of the newer mansions, her mother's house appeared as a wispy memory of the past glowing in the twilight among waves of tall grasses, brilliant pink phlox and yellow primroses for which it had been named. Although a bit wind worn, the old frame house with the low spreading roof and the wide, welcoming verandas seemed as indigenous here as the palmetto trees.<br><br>It had been twenty years since she'd laid eyes on this house. So many years since embarking on the journey from little girl to middle-aged woman. Pulling up to the curb to stare, it occurred to her that while she'd been busy with her life in Chicago, oblivious to the goings-on of the island, this charming little house was here, patiently waiting for her.<br><br>She shifted into gear and slowly drove around the block to the back of the house, pulling into the winding gravel driveway, careful when the wheels dug past the thin layer of gravel to hit sand. She released a short laugh to see the old, shiny gold VW convertible parked beneath the porch. Mama was still driving The Gold Bug? That old ragtop was like a flag. Everyone knew if The Gold Bug was in the driveway, Olivia Rutledge was in residence and ready for visitors.<br><br>Coming to a stop, Cara could feel the miles still moving in her veins. She stared out the windshield at what had always been home and wondered if <em>she</em> was now a visitor at Primrose Cottage, too. Did blood alone earn her the right to call it home? Did hours of pulling weeds from the flower beds and boarding up windows against storms, or years of swinging on the front porch count for anything? She sighed and pulled up the parking brake. Probably not. Besides, she remembered how, in a fit of youthful passion, she'd made a point of shouting to her mother that she wanted nothing at all to do with her, her damn father or anything connected to them.<br><br>Yet the connection tugged, pulling her out from the stale confines of the car into the cool offshore breezes spiked with the heady scent of honeysuckle. She stood, one foot on the sand, the other perched on the car, feeling the undertow sweep her back, back from the shoreline of the world she'd left behind.<br><br>Her memories were crowding her now and she anxiously eyed the remaining feet to her mother's door. She wanted to go in but years of anger rooted her to the spot. So she leaned against the car, formulating what she would say that could break the ice yet still allow her to keep a modicum of self-respect. She'd stay one week, she told herself, gathering courage. Maybe ten days. Any more than that and her mother would drive her crazy and they'd fall back into that pattern of bickering and harsh words followed by long, sulking silences. Oh, God, she thought, rubbing her forehead. Was it a mistake to come back at all?<br><br>All around her the sky darkened to dusky purples and blues and the birds called out their final warnings to go home. A dog howled somewhere in the distance. Then, from around the house, she heard the high melodic hum of a woman's voice.<br><br>Cara moved to peek around the corner. Ambling up the sandy ocean path she saw a diminutive woman in a big, floppy straw hat, a long, faded denim skirt and bright red Keds. Bits of the tune she was humming carried in the breeze, nothing recognizable. In one arm she lugged a red plastic bucket, a telltale sign of one of the island's Turtle Ladies. Cara's heart beat wildly but she remained silent, watching. From this distance she might have mistaken the woman for a young girl. She seemed utterly carefree and oblivious to anything save for the field of wildflowers she passed. She paused en route to stoop and snip a flower, then, resuming her hum, she continued up the path toward Primrose Cottage.<br><br>A million things that Cara had meant to say, a thousand postures she'd meant to strike, evaporated as quickly as sea foam once it hits the shore.<br><br>"Mama!" she called out.<br><br>Her mother stopped short and swung her head in her direction. Bright blue eyes sparkled from under the broad rim of the hat and her mouth opened in a gasp of genuine pleasure. Dropping her bucket, she held out her arms in a joyous welcome. "Caretta!"<br><br>Cara cringed at hearing the name she despised, but closed the distance quickly, following the age-old path of a child to her mother's embrace. Taller by a head, she bent her knees and felt like she always did beside Olivia Rutledge&#x2014;like a clambering bull next to a porcelain doll. Yet when her mother's arms flung around her and squeezed tightly, Cara felt a sweeping flush of childlike pleasure.<br><br>"I've missed you," her mother said softly against her cheek. "You're home again. At last."<br><br>Cara squeezed back but too many years of silence choked all words. She released her hold and, stepping back, it struck her like a fist's blow how much her mother had changed. Olivia Rutledge had become an old woman. Beneath the cheery straw hat her skin was pale and seemed to hang from her prominent cheekbones. The brightness of her blue eyes had dimmed, and though always small and trim, she was now painfully thin.<br><br>How could it have happened so quickly, Cara wondered? Only eighteen months ago at her father's funeral Olivia still retained that timeless quality to her beauty and grace. At sixty-nine she wasn't young, of course, but Cara couldn't think of her mother as <em>old.</em> She was one of those lucky women born with a girlish, slender body and a face that was as scrubbed fresh and naturally pretty as the wildflowers she adored. Her father used to say that he married Olivia because she was as sweet as she looked&#x2014;and it was true. Everyone loved Olivia Rutledge, "Lovie" to those who knew her well.<br><br>But her daughter knew the price that ready smile had cost her mother over the years.<br><br></p><h2>Zombies! Zombies! Zombies! (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Original)</h2><p><i>Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!</i> is the darkest, the living-deadliest, scariest--and dare we say most tasteful--collection of zombie stories&nbsp;ever assembled. It&#x2019;s so good, it's a no-brainer.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is never a dull moment in the world of zombies. They are superstars of horror and they are everywhere, storming the world of print and visual media. Their endless march will never be stopped. It's the Zombie Zeitgeist! Now, with his wide sweep of knowledge and keen eye for great storytelling, Otto Penzler offers a remarkable catalog of zombie literature. Including unstoppable tales from world-renowned authors like Stephen King, Joe R. Lansdale, Robert McCammon, Robert E. Howard,&nbsp;and Richard Matheson to the writer who started it all, W.B. Seabrook, <i>Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!</i> will delight and devour horror fans from coast to coast.<br>&nbsp;<br>Featuring:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Deadly bites<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Satanic Pigeons<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A parade of corpses <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Zombies, zombies, and more zombies</p><p>Otto Penzler lives in New York City.Introduction<br>by Otto Penzler<br><br>ZOMBIES AIN'T WHAT they used to be. Not so long ago, they were safely ensconced on Haiti so the rest of the world could merely scoff at the bizarre myth of the living dead on one relatively small Caribbean island. Well, they have proliferated at an alarming rate, invading the rest of the world, and it seems unlikely that they have any intention of going away anytime soon.<br><br>W. B. Seabrook, in his 1929 book, <i>The Magic Island</i>, recounted &#x201c;true&#x201d; tales of voodoo magic on Haiti bringing the recently dead back to life as slow- moving, virtually brain-dead creatures who would work tirelessly in the fields without pay and without complaint. These stories introduced the zombie to much of the world, though most national folklores have similar tales and legends. A decade after Seabrook&#x2019;s groundbreaking volume, Zora Neale Hurston researched Haitian folklore and told similar stories of eyewitness accounts of zombies, as have subsequent anthropologists, sociologists, and others not prone to imaginative fancies.<br><br>If zombie literature began with the reportage of Seabrook, it had powerful ancestral works on which to draw. Stories of the living dead, or ghouls, or reanimated people, have existed since the <i>Arabian Nights </i>tales and borrowed from other horror story motifs, from the lurching reanimated monster of Mary Shelley&#x2019;s <i>Frankenstein</i> to the undead vampires of John Polidori&#x2019;s <i>The Vampyre</i> and Bram Stoker&#x2019;s <i>Dracula</i>.<br><br>Several of the most distinguished short-story writers of the nineteenth century turned to figures who had been dead but then, uh-oh, were alive. Edgar Allan Poe was almost relentless in his use of the dead coming back to life, most famously in &#x201c;The Fall of the House of Usher&#x201d; but most vividly in his contribution to this volume, &#x201c;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.&#x201d; Guy de Maupassant&#x2019;s poignant &#x201c;Was It a Dream?&#x201d; lingers in the memory as an example of how a corpse leaving a grave can destroy the living without a single act or thought of violence. Ambrose Bierce&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;The Death of Halpin Frayser&#x201d; may be interpreted as a ghost story, a vampire story, or a zombie story, and is equally terrifying as any of them; it is not included in this volume because I selected it for inclusion in <i>The Vampire Archives</i>.<br><br>Now a staple of horror fiction, zombies, as we know them today, have a very short history. Tales of resurrected corpses and ghouls were popular in the weird menace pulps of the 1930s, but these old-fashioned zombies had no taste for human flesh. For that, we can thank George Romero, whose 1968 film <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> introduced this element to these undead critters. Writers, being writers, took to this notion as a more extreme depiction of reanimation and have apparently made every effort to outdo one another in the degree of violence and gore they could bring to the literature.<br><br>While this incursion into the realm of splatterpunk may be welcomed by many readers, I have attempted to maintain some balance in this collection and have omitted some pretty good stories that, in my view, slipped into an almost pornographic sensibility of the need to drench every page with buckets of blood and descriptions of mindless cruelty, torture, and violence. Of course, zombies are mindless, so perhaps this behavior is predictable, but so are many of the stories, and I have opted to include a wider range of fiction. While the characters in early stories are not called zombies, they are the living dead (or, occasionally, apparently so), and they qualify for inclusion.<br><br>Inevitably, some of the most popular writers and their best stories will have been collected in other anthologies, so will seem familiar. For a definitive collection like this one, I wanted them to be included, so if you&#x2019;ve already read the stories by H. P. Lovecraft, Poe, and Stephen King, skip them if you must, though they became popular because they are really good and bear rereading. On the other hand, you will find in these pages some stories that you&#x2019;ve never read by authors of whom you&#x2019;ve never heard, and you are in for a treat.<br><br>To cover the broad spectrum and significant history of zombie literature required a good bit of research, and I am indebted to the welcome and needed assistance of numerous experts in the genre, most notably John Pelan, Robert Weinberg, John Knott, Chris Roden, Joel Frieman, Michele Slung, and Gardner Dozois.</p><h2>Whats Science All About</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>101 Amazing Things to Do in Ireland: Ireland Travel Guide (Dublin Travel Guide, Cork Travel, Kerry Travel, Belfast Travel)</h2><p><p><b>Hey there!

You can get a terrific dog by dumb luck&#x2014;I know, because twice now I&#x2019;ve adopted dogs who just happened to show up at the right moment&#x2014;but really, it&#x2019;s not the best strategy. <br>The Internet&#x2019;s rich in quizzes and checklists that offer to tell you what kind of dog to get. I tried a couple while I was working on this chapter. I was afraid they&#x2019;d be silly, and they are. They ask stupid questions&#x2014;for example, &#x201c;Do you want a guarding dog?&#x201d; How can I put this? <i>You don&#x2019;t want a guarding dog</i>. Dogs bred and reared to be suspicious of strangers make, let&#x2019;s say, problematic family pets; for one thing, they can&#x2019;t distinguish among burglars, your dinner guests, and a bunch of EMTs. You <i>might</i> want a good-size dog who can bark on cue, but I promise you that&#x2019;s about all the guarding you need. <br>As for the quiz results, they were loopy. One told me I should get a &#x201c;Faux French Bulldog,&#x201d; whatever that is (is it made of polyester?), or one of several other currently popular designer mixes. Another suggested a mixed-breed (so far, so good) or a Field Spaniel as my two best choices. Oh, lord. I have lived with several dogs and worked with hundreds, so I kind of know what I like. I like whip-smart, athletic, sociable, better-keep-me-busy-or-I&#x2019;ll-get-annoying dogs, and although I can handle springtime shedding, the thought of grooming a dog regularly all year round makes me want to disembowel myself.* I&#x2019;m a sucker for Pit Bulls and Pit Bull mixes. I really like herding-dog mixes. And&#x2014;wild card here&#x2014;I am a pushover for a nice Chihuahua. Spaniels&nbsp;&#x2026; People, I know some great spaniels, but they&#x2019;re not the right dogs for me. As for supporting the puppy mill/designer mix industry&#x2014;no. Just no. <br>The results were not only way off base in terms of my actual preferences, they were also way too specific. Not that it doesn&#x2019;t make sense to consider breed <i>type</i>&#x2014;it does, because breeds and groups of breeds (and their mixes) tend to show behavioral similarities. But a list of five or seven or a dozen breeds implies &#x201c;Get one of these and you&#x2019;re set.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not so simple. When you get a dog, even a dog who belongs to a known breed, you don&#x2019;t get a <i>breed;</i> you get an <i>individual dog,</i> who may or may not have read the breed description (which may or may not be worthless, anyway; see &#x201c;What If You&#x2019;re Looking for a Particular Breed?&#x201d;). Work the other way around: Consider what qualities you want in a companion dog, and then look for those qualities. Breed and breed group can narrow your search, but the dog you&#x2019;re looking for may turn up pretty much anywhere.* This is the beauty of the behavior descriptions and matchmaking paradigms some shelters use&#x2014;they focus on the qualities of individual dogs and try to pair human adopters with compatible dogs. <br>And, oh, yes, then there&#x2019;s love. Love is not so predictable. You may fall in love with a completely inappropriate dog. It happens. Frankly, all my dogs have been more or less inappropriate in one way or another. If you thought you wanted a sweet, soft spaniel mix but then fell head over heels for a fast, independent Jack Russell Terrier, fine! But, having chosen that JRT, you must now live up to her; no getting mad when she&#x2019;d rather learn new tricks than cuddle. As the great trainer Leslie Nelson has said, &#x201c;Love the dog you have, not the one you wish you had.&#x201d; <br>Falling in love with a dog who&#x2019;s not your type is not necessarily bad; you thought you wanted to cuddle on the couch all evening, but hey, teaching a new trick every other day turns out to be a blast, it gives you a huge sense of accomplishment, and you&#x2019;re crazy about your brainiac dog. Excellent. Purposely adopting a behaviorally troubled dog is quite another matter. <i>Don&#x2019;t do it</i>. Shy dogs, scared dogs, fear-aggressive dogs will pull at your heartstrings&#x2014;of course they will. Then they may refuse to set foot outdoors, or may growl and snap at children or visitors, or may send other dogs and people to the hospital; and then you have to pay someone a lot of money to help, and have I mentioned yet that no ethical trainer will guarantee a happy result?* A really difficult dog may also turn <i>you</i> into a trainer specializing in behavior modification, which is what happened to me. Not that it hasn&#x2019;t been great, but there are less emotionally trying routes to a new career. Behaviorally healthy, &#x201c;easy&#x201d; dogs also deserve loving homes. They really really do. <br>How to Decide What Kind of Dog You Want <br>Dogs take a lot of time and work, so start by walking yourself and your family through a typical day and see how&#x2014;and whether!&#x2014;a dog would fit in. Consider the following questions. <br>&#x2022; Can you easily see when you&#x2019;d exercise the dog? <br>&#x2022; How will you manage to get a nine-week-old puppy outdoors to pee and poop every hour or two for his first week in your home, and with gradually decreasing frequency afterward? <br>&#x2022; On what weekday evenings can you and your partner reliably attend that basic manners class? <br>&#x2022; If you work long hours, who&#x2019;ll give the dog a break or two so she isn&#x2019;t crossing her legs all afternoon and into the evening? <br>&#x2022; Do you come home from work wiped out? Your puppy or dog will need attention, care, and training regardless. <br>&#x2022; If you have children, are they mature enough to understand that animals are not toys&#x2014;that they feel pain, need rest, and sometimes want to be left alone? <br>&#x2022; Who will supervise the puppy/dog during your kids&#x2019; playdates and make sure the children don&#x2019;t overwhelm him, or vice versa? <br>&#x2022; Are your children mature enough to participate in care for your dog? <br>&#x2022; If you have other animals, how are they likely to respond to the new adoptee? If they are old or ill, can you realistically and humanely expect them to adapt? <br>If, on reflection, a puppy would be more work than you and your family can manage right now, but you long to have a dog, seriously consider adopting an adult from a shelter or a rescue group. I&#x2019;m not necessarily talking about an adolescent or young dog, either; she&#x2019;ll be almost as much work as a puppy, at least for a little while. Think &#x201c;mature adult&#x201d; or even &#x201c;senior citizen.&#x201d; <br>MATCH UP NEEDS AND PERSONALITY <br>So you&#x2019;ve decided that your life has room for a dog, and you have some idea of whether you&#x2019;re up for the challenge of a puppy or might do better adopting an adult. Now it&#x2019;s time to match personalities. <br>A True Dog Story: Charlie <br>One of the sweetest dogs I&#x2019;ve ever met turned up at the Brookyn branch of the New York City municipal shelter some years ago, brought in as a stray. Charlie was a big (90 + pounds) black mixed-breed, not much to look at and grizzled in the face. He&#x2019;d come out wagging for walks, then droop when I put him back in his kennel. He wasn&#x2019;t the most interactive fellow in the world, but he had a big neon sign over his head saying &#x201c;I Am a Depressed Old Dog,&#x201d; so I crossed my fingers and did a formal behavior evaluation (see the section on shelters and rescue groups, later in this chapter, for more about these). Charlie did just fine, not that anybody wanted to adopt a huge, old, not-super-responsive mixed-breed dog. And then he developed kennel cough (bordetella), turning himself into a huge, old, not-super-responsive, <i>sick</i> mixed-breed dog. New York&#x2019;s municipal shelter system must by law accept every animal brought in, so the facilities are chronically short on space. When room has to be made, the less adoptable dogs die first. I did something I never, ever do: I leaned hard on two friends of mine who had recently lost a beloved dog. They didn&#x2019;t want to adopt; they needed time to grieve. Tough, said I. <br>You know how this ends, right? My friends came to the shelter. They left with Charlie. He lived five more years and became a certified therapy dog. And my friends forgave me my arm-twisting. Scout&#x2019;s honor. <br>Though online quizzes are useless or worse, certain shelters describe their charges&#x2019; behavior in a way nicely adaptable to your search whether you&#x2019;re adopting or buying. They rate aspects of doggy personalities on a continuum&#x2014;&#x201c;shy&#x201d; to &#x201c;bold,&#x201d; for instance, or &#x201c;affectionate&#x201d; to &#x201c;aloof.&#x201d; You can turn that strategy around to help you decide what kind of dog you&#x2019;d get along with best. Are you&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>energetic ___________ laid-back? <br>If you&#x2019;re on the laid-back end of the spectrum, the questions about how a dog would fit in to your life may already have steered you away from a puppy. Remember, adult dogs vary in energy level too! <br>impatient ___________ patient? <br>Impatient people may do best with adult dogs who don&#x2019;t need a lot of training and who don&#x2019;t have problem habits to repair. <br>anxious ___________ calm? <br>Anxious people, do yourselves a favor and don&#x2019;t get barky, reactive dogs&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll make you nuts. <br>interested in grooming ___________ okay with brushing out the winter coat ___________ bored to tears by grooming? <br>Say you&#x2019;re bored by grooming but willing to deal with the winter coat, up to a point. No Huskies, Malamutes, or Poodles for you, unless you want to shell out big bucks for grooming. <br>fastidious ___________ a mudpuppy? <br>Dogs are filthy, okay? They eat feces and roll in dead things. Accept this. If you&#x2019;re going to need to wash the dog a lot, please also take the time to teach her to enjoy being bathed. <br>physically affectionate ___________ hands-off? <br>If you like cuddling with dogs, look for a dog who likes cuddling; you&#x2019;ll be sad if you adopt one who has handling issues or who prefers nearby floor space to the spot next to you on the couch. Also, be aware that small doesn&#x2019;t equal cuddly; people tend to force touch on small dogs, and it makes the dogs crazy. <br>fascinated by training ___________ bored to tears by training? <br>If you&#x2019;re bored by training and you get a smart, energetic dog, neither of you is going to be happy. <br>athletic ___________ a couch potato? <br>Couch potatoes, how about a nice middle-aged or old dog who&#x2019;s been displaced by the recession or a family illness? Leave the adolescent Pit mixes and the field-bred hunting dogs for people who won&#x2019;t want to kill them two days after bringing them home. <br>robust ___________ frail? <br>Say you have osteoporosis and being knocked down could cost you a broken hip. Pass on the body-slamming adolescent Lab mix and go for a smaller, quieter adult dog instead. Also, if you are very small and your prospective dog is very big, think about how you&#x2019;ll physically take care of him if he gets tottery in old age. (Assistive devices do exist.) <br>quick to go into action ___________ slow to go into action? <br>If you&#x2019;re proactive, you&#x2019;ll find your dog easier to train. For instance, if you&#x2019;re slow to get up when your puppy starts to sniff and circle, housetraining will be more laborious. There&#x2019;s no shame in being pokey, but you&#x2019;ll probably be happier with a dog whose behavior is low maintenance. <br>confident ___________ not so confident? <br>Nope, this isn&#x2019;t about &#x201c;alpha.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s about stigma. Certain breeds and types are stigmatized, and if you fall for a Pit Bull/Rottweiler/Doberman/Mastiff some folks will curl their lips at you no matter how nice he is. It can be tough to take. <br>Another question to ask yourself is what aspects of life with a dog might drive you crazy. Check out Chapter 11, &#x201c;Stuff Dogs Do That Annoys People,&#x201d; for a whole range of normal dog behaviors that tend to get on human nerves. I stress, these are normal dog behaviors; if you can&#x2019;t stand even a little bit of barking, the &#x201c;breed&#x201d; you want is the one scientifically known as <i>Felis catus</i> (and its members have their own methods of making people tear their hair out*). I&#x2019;ll offer a few general suggestions, but please bear in mind the following: <br>1. Every individual trainer&#x2019;s experience is skewed&#x2014;by whatever her specialty is, by what breeds are popular locally, because small samples are always skewed, by her own perceptions, by her development of a reputation as being &#x201c;good with X problem or Z breed&#x201d; (and hence being sent a lot of dogs with X problem or of Z breed). <br>2. Every individual dog is an individual (at least, behaviorally speaking; there&#x2019;s probably no such thing as a Poodle who needs no grooming). I know a woman who has had four or five Shelties over her lifetime and who swears on her mother&#x2019;s grave that all except the current dog were non-barkers. Whenever I meet someone who has a Sheltie, I tell them about this woman, because I enjoy hearing their bitter laugh. <br>3. I mention all these breeds as points of reference, not because I believe you should focus your search on pedigreed dogs. Whether a dog&#x2019;s a mixed-breed or a registered Byelorussian Flapdoodle tells you absolutely nothing about her physical or behavioral health or whether you&#x2019;d enjoy living with each other.* <br>Quick and Dirty Tip <br>What Kind of Dog to Get If You Have Kids <br>You know what makes dog trainers want to bang our heads against the wall? Cute pictures of puppies and babies, or puppies and toddlers, nestled among the daisies, cuddling. Head, meet wall. Here&#x2019;s why. <br>How much supervision does your toddler need? How wrung out do you get in the course of a day, providing that supervision? Right. How much supervision do you think a puppy needs? <i>Every waking minute.</i> Just like your child. You can&#x2019;t always take good care of two species of infant simultaneously. Say you&#x2019;re bathing Babylini when Puppalini wakes from his nap. Puppalini needs to go out <i>right now,</i> but you can&#x2019;t leave Babylini. Puppalini pees on the floor. Now not only do you have an extra mess to clean up, but also every such accident will make housetraining harder. <br>Then there&#x2019;s the problem I mentioned in the questionnaire&#x2014;very young children don&#x2019;t clearly understand that other beings have feelings and needs. (Puppies obviously don&#x2019;t, either.) I was once called to a household where the 10-week-old puppy was growling at the children. They were very nice children, but they did not understand that a sleeping puppy needs his rest. The puppy wasn&#x2019;t a bad puppy; he was <i>exhausted</i>. And exhaustion had brought him to the point where now, at just 10 weeks, he had &#x201c;aggression toward approaching children&#x201d; in his behavioral repertoire.* <br>Please: Either don&#x2019;t get a dog till Junior&#x2019;s old enough to regulate much of his own behavior, or get a middle-aged dog who is housetrained, doesn&#x2019;t need an hour of off-leash aerobic exercise every morning before breakfast, and utterly adores children and also will go take a nap in the master bedroom instead of trying to grab their ankles when they play tag. <br>While I&#x2019;m at it, get a medium-size or larger dog. Yes, yes, small person, small dog, very cute. A small, breakable dog combined with a small, active child can all too easily lead to a grouchy dog plus a child clutching his hand and crying, &#x201c;He bit me!&#x201d; or a dog with his leg in a cast plus a child crying, &#x201c;Mommy, Daddy, I didn&#x2019;t mean to step on Scooter!&#x201d; Or both. Sturdy, solid, adoring, unflappable: That&#x2019;s what you want in a children&#x2019;s dog. (P.S. &#x201c;Adoring and unflappable&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t constitute a license for children to ride on the dog, pull his ears, or jump on his belly while he&#x2019;s sleeping.) <br>* The parents&#x2019; failure to supervise and intervene was a problem here, obviously. But we might save a lip curl for the breeder who sold a puppy to a household with a four-year-old and a six-year-old where the parents had n...</p><h2>Bead by Bead: The Ancient Way of Praying Made New</h2><p><i>A creative way to pray &#x2013; across faith traditions &#x2013; made new for all who seek a more intimate experience with God.

Professor James Knowlson, Beckett's chosen biographer and a leading authority on Beckett, vividly recreates Beckett's life from his birth in a rural suburb of Dublin in 1906 to his death in Paris in 1989, revealing the real man behind the literary giant. Scrupulously researched and filled with previously unknown information garnered from interviews with the author and his friends, family, and contemporaries, Knowlson's unparalleled work is the definitive Beckett biography of our time.<br><br>Nearing the end of his life, Samuel Beckett chose James Knowlson to be his biographer because he "knows my work best." One of the world's leading authorities on Beckett, Knowlson has drawn on his twenty-year friendship with the Nobel Prize winner, more than one hundred interviews, and research in dozens of archival collections-many previously untapped by scholars-to produce this definitive biography of one of hte century's leading writers in both English and French.<br><br>Damned to Fame follows teh reclusive literary giant's life from his birth in Foxrock, a rural suburb of Dublin, in 1906 to his death in Paris in 1989. Knowlson brilliantly re-creates Beckett's early years as a struggling author in Paris, his travels through Germany in 1936-37 as the Nazis were consolidating their power, his service in the French Resistance during World War II, and the years of literary fame and financial success that followed the first performance of his controversial Waiting For Godot (1953).<br><br>Paris between the wars was a city vibrant with experimentation, both in the arts and in personal lifestyle, and Knowlson introduces us to the writers and painters who, along with the young Beckett, populated his bohemian community. Most notable was James Joyce, a fellow Irishman who became Beckett's friend and mentor and influenced him to devote his life to writing. We also meet the women in Beckett's life-his domineering mother, May; his cousin Peggy Sinclair, who died at a tragically young age; Ethna McCarthy, his first love, whom he immortalized in his poetry and prose; Peggy Guggenheim, the American heiress and patron of the arts; and the strong and independent Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil, whom he met in the late 1930s and married in 1961.<br>Beyond recounting many previously unknown aspects of the writer's life, including his strong support for human rights and other political causes, Knowlson explores in fascinating detail teh roots of Beckett's works. He shows not only how the relationship between Beckett's own experiences and his work became more oblique over time, but also how his startling postmodern images were inspired by the paintings of the Old Masters, such as Antonello da Messina, Durer, Rembrandt, and Caravaggio.<br><br>Perhaps most striking of all is Knowlson's portrait of Beckett's complex personality. Although Beckett is often depicted as melancholic, self-critical, and intensely preoccupied with his work, his own letters reveal him to have been also a witty, resilient, and compassionate man who could respond to adversity with humor and who inspired deep affection in his friends.<br></p><p>Samuel Beckett, a talent so exceptional that he created masterpieces in both French and English, shied away from the limelight for much of his life. However James Knowlson, in this amazing biography, shows Beckett wasn't entirely hesitant to talk about himself; the book relies heavily on interviews with Beckett to reconstruct the writer's dizzying career. Knowlson fills the pages with exhaustive detail--some major, some minor. In addition, he analyzes the influences on and evolution of Beckett's work. Through it all a larger picture emerges, one of the artist at work and in life. <b>Damned to Fame</b> is a necessary addition to any study of Beckett.James Knowlson is the founder of the Beckett Archive (now the Beckett International Foundation) at the University of Reading, where he holds a Personal Chair of French.</p><h2>Adobe Moon (Wyatt Earp: An American Odyssey)</h2><p>&#34;Adobe Moon,&#34; Mark Warren&#39;s first book in a trilogy on Wyatt Earp is more than historical fiction. Though it is a period piece of the 19th century, it is a timeless story that relates to all of us.Regardless of when or where a person lives in time, each of us is faced with a universal plight: How do we become a man or a woman? And how do we find our place in the world?Do the times shape us? Yes, just as surely as the place and people around us. Family, especially. It has always been this way. What if you wanted to run away from home to fight in a war . . .but you were too young? What if you were forced to labor over 80 acres of crops by an overbearing father who knew nothing about giving some slack to his sons? And, as a fourteen year old, after accruing the requisite calluses of farming, what aspirations might you consider for your vocation? This is the story of such a boy who never quite finds all those answers. But because of his physicality, confidence, and a willingness to exercise deliberate courage, he does find his place in a life much admired by his peers. His name will always be spoken anytime that a conversation arises about justice vs. law and order . . . and how those American commodities do not always balance on the scales of a courtroom bench. His name was Wyatt Earp. Earp was many things-farmer, freight hauler, stage driver,railroad wrangler, husband, constable, wood splitter, accused horse thief, brothel bouncer, buffalo hunter, gambler, and lawman-most of this in the &#34;new&#34; and raw land of America&#39;s untapped West. The possibilities seemed endless for Wyatt, but he will be remembered in that last category . . . peace officer, a role he did not want. Instead, it would seem that history wanted it for him. He was that good at it.</p><p>I got hooked on this story when I was seven years old. I spent the next 63 years sorting legend from fact. Although this is historical fiction, I have written it as close to the truth as I know how. And as usual, the truth is so much more compelling than the myth. Welcome to the real story.It is 1862. With his older brothers fighting in the war, Wyatt Earp is left to manage the family&#39;s Iowa farm under his father&#39;s iron rule. These years of labor produce in him an ambition to seek his fortunes by his wits rather than by the sweat of his back. The open territory to the west, he knows, offers that opportunity. On his way to California he meets a beguiling Mexican girl, who tells him of the &#34;adobe moon,&#34; a rusty-hued orb that reminds a man: If you do not achieve your dreams, you must settle for what you have. Wyatt rejects this idea, but it haunts him nevertheless, as he takes odd jobs, becomes a constable in a small Missouri town, and ultimately sinks into a depression where the line of ethics blur. Fed up with his self-made squalor, he returns to the West for a second chance at a proper life, and in a Kansas cattle town he comes face to face with his salvation...and his destiny as a lawman with his own iron rule.</p><h2>America Besieged</h2><p><p><em>America Besieged</em> deals with the underlying forces within U.S. society that deeply affect our lives. Showing how we are being misled and harmed by those who profess to have our interests at heart, Michael Parenti writes: "We are indeed a nation besieged, not from without but from within, not subverted from below but from above; the moneyed power exercises a near monopoly influence over our political life, over the economy, the state, and the media. Some Americans are astonished to hear of it. Others have had their suspicions, although they may not be quite sure how it all adds up. This book invites the reader to stop blaming the powerless and poor and, in that good old American phrase, start 'following the money.' That is the first and most important step toward lifting the siege and bringing democracy back to life."</p><br><p>"Parenti's . . . voice is sharp and urgent, providing a short but comprehensive course in radical analysis. He ticks off what he feels are America's problems: a political culture all too ready to worship politicians rather than ask hard questions ("[I]t is the essence of democracy," he cautions, "that we not trust and not have faith in our leaders"); a fundamentally unjust economy in which "pollution, like sin, is regularly denounced but vigorously practiced"; a state shockingly willing to tolerate the murder of left-wing dissidents from other countries; and a narrow-minded, jingoistic mass media that serves as the handmaid of corporate power (why, he asks, did neo-Nazi--but pro-capitalist--David Duke's failed Senate bid receive so much more attention than Socialist Bernard Sanders's victory?). Rather more hyperbolically, he notes that the recent Olympics "felt more like Munich 1936 than Atlanta 1996." Opinionated and angry, but also reasonable and sincerely hopeful in the possibility of a better future through collective action, this is a book Joe Hill would have loved." &#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><br><p>Michael Parenti, one of America's most astute and entertaining political analysts, is the author of <em>Against Empire, Dirty Truths, Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism, Democracy for the Few, Land of Idols: Political Mythology in America</em>, and many other books.</p></p><p><p>Michael Parenti, PhD Yale, is an internationally known author and lecturer.

We think we know the answer, but in this lively and startlingly original reconsideration, Alec Ryrie argues that people embraced unbelief much as they have always chosen their worldviews: through their hearts more than their minds.</p><p>Looking back to the crisis of the Reformation and beyond, <i>Unbelievers</i> shows how, long before philosophers started to make the case for atheism, powerful cultural currents were challenging traditional faith. These tugged in different ways not only on celebrated thinkers such as Machiavelli, Montaigne, Hobbes, and Pascal, but on men and women at every level of society whose voices we hear through their diaries, letters, and court records.</p><p>Ryrie traces the roots of atheism born of anger, a sentiment familiar to anyone who has ever cursed a corrupt priest, and of doubt born of anxiety, as Christians discovered their faith was flimsier than they had believed. As the Reformation eroded time-honored certainties, Protestant radicals defended their faith by redefining it in terms of ethics. In the process they set in motion secularizing forces that soon became transformational. <i>Unbelievers</i> tells a powerful emotional history of doubt with potent lessons for our own angry and anxious age.</p></p><p>Alec Ryrie is a prizewinning historian of the Reformation and Protestantism. He is the author of <i>Unbelievers: An Emotional History of Doubt</i> and <i>Protestants: The Faith That Made the Modern World.</i> Ryrie is Professor of the History of Christianity at Durham University and Professor of Divinity at Gresham College, London.&#x201c;Most of us like to believe that we believe what we believe because rigorous reasoning and reliable evidence have led us there. Most of us are wrong...In reality, as Alec Ryrie shows in this short but beautifully crafted history of early doubt, unbelief was (and is) chosen for &#x2018;instinctive, inarticulate and intuitive&#x2019; reasons just as much as is belief...He...[argues] persuasively that unbelief was as much, if not more, about what people felt as what they thought, in particular a confluence of moral outrage and personal anxiety...<i>Unbelievers</i> covers much ground in a short space with deep erudition and considerable wit.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Spectator</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An informative, engaging, creative, and persuasive account of the origin of unbelief in western societies. The research is deep and the writing sprightly. Ryrie&#x2019;s central argument is that unbelief existed as practice before it existed in theory, that moral intuitions counted much more heavily than philosophical arguments in the emergence of atheism, and that &#x2018;an emotional history&#x2019; of anger at Christian authorities and anxiety arising from disputes internal to Christianity pointed the way to the rejection of traditional Christianity and open atheism of more recent centuries.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Noll, coeditor of <i>Protestantism after 500 Years</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;How has unbelief come to dominate so many Western societies? The usual account invokes the advance of science and rational knowledge. Ryrie&#x2019;s alternative, in which emotions are the driving force, offers new and interesting insights into our past and present.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Taylor, author of <i>A Secular Age</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The brilliance of this book lies in its reimagining of an old debate stirred by Lucien Febvre and his many critics. Ryrie takes us beyond the slightly stale polemic of the leading theological figures of the early modern world to let us hear the voices of men and women who lived through the torrid age of religious change. In <i>Unbelievers</i> we encounter heart-wrenching expressions of faith and its absence with nuanced attention to words and modulations of emotions. We find preachers, female writers, dramatists, poets, and essayists who struggled daily with a religion that demanded faith. Ryrie rejects easy connections between their world and ours while offering an arresting consideration of how their voices shaped what came after them. Deep insights are leavened with characteristic wit and humor, making this book a crucial read for anyone thinking about religion in our time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bruce Gordon, author of <i>Calvin</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With wit and remarkable breadth of learning, Ryrie addresses an issue that touches us all.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rev. John O&#x2019;Malley, author of <i>Vatican I</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Masterly...Ryrie&#x2019;s deeply researched work is an enlightening ramble through intellectual history of opposition to Christian belief that will appeal to any reader interested in religious scholarship.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Ryrie] finds that unbelief is much older and more nuanced than many historians have credited.

It's hard to imagine a personal history more transporting that this one."&#x2015;Judith Lewis, <i>Los Angels Times Book Review </i></p><p><i>Trespass</i> is the story of one woman's struggle to gain footing in inhospitable territory. A wilderness activist and apostate Mormon, Amy Irvine sought respite in the desert outback of southern Utah's red-rock country after her father's suicide, only to find out just how much of an interloper she was among her own people. But more than simply an exploration of personal loss, <i>Trespass</i> is an elegy for a dying world, for the ruin of one of our most beloved and unique desert landscapes and for our vanishing connection to it. Fearing what her father's fate might somehow portend for her, Irvine retreated into the remote recesses of the Colorado Plateau&#x2015;home not only to the world's most renowned national parks but also to a rugged brand of cowboy Mormonism that stands in defiant contrast to the world at large. Her story is one of ruin and restoration, of learning to live among people who fear the wilderness the way they fear the devil and how that fear fuels an antagonism toward environmental concerns that pervades the region. At the same time, Irvine mourns her own loss of wildness and disconnection from spirituality, while ultimately discovering that the provinces of nature and faith are not as distinct as she once might have believed.</p></p><p><p>Formerly a nationally ranked competitive rock climber, <b>Amy Irvine </b>was for five years the development director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.</p>Prologue<br>My home is a red desert that trembles with spirits and bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are two reasons I came here: my father&#x2019;s death, and the lion man who prowled my dreams. Perhaps it was coincidence, but a man&#x2014;half wild, ravenous beyond words&#x2014;slid from the dream world into the mud of the waking one the same year my father left this world for another.<br>Ghosts. Paw prints. I have tried to stay put.<br>The lion man is Herb. His name, his grandfather&#x2019;s. It doesn&#x2019;t quite suit him, but then, nothing about the civilized world does. Even my mother, who prefers all things tame, cannot accept it. Instead, she calls him Red for his long copper curls, for the heart pulsing on his sleeve. His eyes are a piercing topaz. And he purrs of dimensions other than this one&#x2014;says he sees and hears things differently and that&#x2019;s why he makes up his own rules. Me, I am at a loss for words. After contending daily with the lion man&#x2019;s incorrigible ways, I still don&#x2019;t know what to call him.<br>If Herb is red, then my father was blue. Perpetually immersed in water and nostalgia, to the point of inertia, he passed the days hunting&#x2014;mostly in cattails on the edge of the Great Salt Lake, just outside Salt Lake City. There he sat motionless, as if he could halt time. It was his attempt to deny the seductive sirens of civility&#x2014;their incessant beckonings to behave, to belong. He acted as if all that mattered was the water, and the sound of wings flapping overhead. He was a good shot.<br>But he lost his fluidity. The lake swelled, then retreated. Constrained by convention, dulled by bourbon, his primal reflexes failed. When the banks of soft marsh mud imploded beneath his feet, he simply could not respond. Finally, on the first night of the new millennium, as the rest of the world toasted a new era, my father put a bullet through his own heart.<br>the redrock desert where I made my home sits on a tall, arid land mass called the Colorado Plateau. This physiographic province sprawls across northern New Mexico and Arizona, western Colorado, and nearly all of the southern half of Utah&#x2014;my home state. Perhaps the most isolated portion of the Plateau falls within the boundaries of San Juan County, in Utah&#x2019;s southeastern corner. After my thirty-four years in Salt Lake City&#x2014;the state&#x2019;s urban capital, at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, in the northern region of the state&#x2014;this remote and rural portion of the desert was a welcome change.<br>San Juan County is the size of three small New England states. And of its 7,884 square miles, only 8 percent of the land is owned privately. The rest is either Indian or federal land&#x2014;managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and the Forest Service. Included within these federal jurisdictions are Canyonlands National Park, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and Hovenweep and Natural Bridges National Monuments. Also included are two million acres of BLM lands with hardly any special designations&#x2014;loosely managed for &#x201c;multiple use,&#x201d; which means they can be utilized for grazing, mining, logging, and nearly any form of recreation.<br>So scenic are these lands that if any of them&#x2014;any at all&#x2014;could be acquired, they would be considered prime real estate. But San Juan County, by and large, is not for sale. The result: Less than two people per square mile. Not one shopping mall or gated community. Only two stoplights and a single liquor store.<br>But there are eleven Mormon churches&#x2014;three of them built right on Indian lands.<br>In the late autumn of our first year in San Juan County, Herb and I hiked into a deep canyon on Cedar Mesa&#x2014;the connective tissue between the Abajo Mountains and the San Juan River. It was a cold and gray afternoon; the cottonwood trees in the canyon bottom had lost their gold medallions and stood wretched. The birds were gone. Everything was stripped, utterly silent. We tiptoed across stones made sleek and spherical by flash floods. Herb stopped and looked up at an ancient Indian ruin, high on the ledge above us. Perhaps a thousand years old, its earthen walls still stood. The two windows were dark and hollow, like the eyes of an unlit jack-o&#x2019;-lantern.<br>The lion man turned to me, his eyes dilated in the fading light. He said, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever felt so alone.<br>I disagreed. The ghosts were everywhere, watching. And even their company would prove to be too much.<br>Soon afterward, Herb and I bought a cabin on ten acres. There were no phone lines, no power lines, no pipes to deliver water or gas. With no service to collect what we discarded, we were careful about what we used in the first place. And with scarcely an aquifer of groundwater in the bedrock beneath shallow soils, there was little point in drilling a well. Instead, we hauled water from town in an old pickup and stored it in a cistern.<br>In winter, the snow would come suddenly and pick dogfights with the sky. The wind would scream like a woman assaulted. On winter mornings, Herb and I wrestled beneath the covers, to see who must leave our bed to light the stove and scrape ice from the solar panels that stood in the yard like a broken-off piece of spaceship. Summers were just as trying. Mornings would heat up like a struck match, and by noon the sky was bruised with thunderheads. When we moved in, I had laughed at the three lightning rods on the tar-paper roof&#x2014;now I know they weren&#x2019;t the least bit excessive. The rain comes and goes so fast, often it does no good. In this redrock desert, only one thing is constant: Evaporation duels saturation&#x2014;a lesson on how easily matter can vaporize.<br>The cabin sat on the rim of a canyon, halfway between the towns of Blanding and Monticello. From the kitchen table was a stunning view&#x2014;thousands of acres of scarcely interrupted public land and Indian land, yawning south for over one hundred miles. In the middle of the view lies the Four Corners, where the Colorado Plateau states converge with rectilinear perfection. This ninety-degree meeting of state lines is arbitrary, and invisible to the eye. But each day, as the light shifted across the sky, I detected new canyons, new mesas. The bones of the earth illuminated.<br>It was my father&#x2019;s mother, Ada, who first brought me to this desert, who taught me what to look for. I was six years old when I first sat in red sand, leaning over her shoulder to watch as she painted land and sky. She loved the capricious geography&#x2014;how it rose and fell like the spikes and troughs on an erratic cardiogram. She pointed out the sagebrush plain that suddenly plunged one thousand feet into a canyon of bare pink stone, glistening with seeps and springs; the roiling river beneath a ragged, bloody spine of a steeply rising anticline; the expletive of a sandstone minaret, erupting from the desert floor like a bold stroke of red ink.<br>An artist of abstractions, Ada sometimes made the rock look like water. She taught me all that she learned from this place&#x2014;to look past the obvious, to see what might emerge at the edges.<br>There is only wind, water, and stone, Amy. Because of them, the desert is constantly undone.<br>She understood erosion. How the fierce winds&#x2014;Arctic air in winter, gulf streams in summer&#x2014;could scour away the soil until there was only bedrock. How the Dirty Devil, the Colorado, and the San Juan rivers&#x2014;opaque ribbons of chocolate and jade&#x2014;could gnaw at the sandy banks, granule by granule, until there was nothing left to stand on. How even the smallest seismic shift beneath the earth&#x2019;s crust could calve pinnacles from canyon walls, or unearth the remnants of ancient peoples.<br>Early on, I remember sitting on a sandy beach at Lake Powell, in Glen Canyon Recreation Area. On a pad of paper, my grandmother sketched the cliffs that rose from the depths of the water. They were the color of raw salmon flesh. Sunlight leaped from the water and bedazzled the walls. Suddenly she dropped her pastel crayon, held her hands up against the sun. The rays burned through the pale webs of skin between her fingers.<br>And color. It shifts. Light changes everything.<br>She marveled at how, in one hour, a single rock formation could run the gauntlet of reds, oranges, even purples. Each shade was so exquisite, she said, that it defied description&#x2014;or any other kind of human attempt at acquisition. This may have frustrated another observer, but in my grandmother&#x2019;s mind, that intangible, luminous fluidity was the key to liberation. An atheist, an aesthete, she never tried to reinvent. Instead, she unleashed her self on the canvas. In doing so, she managed to interpret the desert&#x2019;s sensuality, particle by particle. Back in Salt Lake, she presented her work in galleries. From desert to city. She glided effortlessly between two contradictory worlds, translating the liquid language of landscape&#x2014;a place others have called barren and harsh.<br>Moving to southern Utah, I imagined myself as Ada. A visionary who could see, interpret, the desert&#x2019;s nuances. A woman free to go anywhere the senses led. A woman who could sustain herself on beauty alone.<br>The desert&#x2019;s people seemed only a minor obstacle. Mostly cowboy, mostly Mormon, they have their own way of seeing things. But I am used to this: My mother&#x2019;s side of the family possesses the same peculiar brand of faith&#x2014;a rawhide religion unlike anything you see in places more verdant, more populated. On public lands, in the high desert of southern Idaho&#x2014;in a place not at all unlike San Juan County&#x2014;they too run cattle and submit themselves not so much to the government as to God.

The caller was a man with a charming British accent and a sparkling manner alive with animation and humor, who introduced himself as Chris Robinson. He had read about my lab at the University of Arizona, he said, and was calling to announce that he wanted me to test his abilities to see if I could conclude that he was, indeed, getting tips from some otherworldly source. </p><p> After a near-death experience thirteen years earlier, weird messages had begun arriving in his sleep -- dreams that foretold the future, especially about murders and terrorism. </p><p> Over the years, he said, evidence obtained through his dreams had helped put many criminals behind bars. Because of Robinson's information, murderers who thought they had escaped were caught, IRA bombers were captured, and corrupt members of the police force were uncovered and sent to prison. Fingering corrupt cops and detectives didn't make Christopher popular with British law enforcement, he said. Although they had continued to listen to his information and act on it, he said, he had been kept at arm's length and mistrusted. </p><p> I had no reason to think anyone could really do what Christopher was claiming. I listened patiently as he shared stories that were amazing and outrageous. I found most of what he said virtually impossible to believe. He claimed that a book called <i>Dream Detective</i> had been published in England about many of his cases and that he would send me a copy. The book actually arrived, and I found it supported his claims, apparently substantiating his uncanny skill. </p><p> I was about to start on a journey on which this total stranger from England would ultimately propel me to reconsider the entire history of my scientific career, and in the process come to new and meaningful conclusions. </p><p> We had a series of phone calls after that. Trained in clinical psychology, I listened closely for signs of psychosis or thought disorder. He not only sounded sane but was insisting that he fly over from England if I would conduct tests to verify his claims of dreams that foretold the future. This blue-collar worker with marginal income was offering to buy his own airline ticket and pay for his own hotel and meals if I was willing to try to help him find out, once and for all, what his power really represented. </p><p> Over the next weeks Christopher and I discussed a highly controlled yet seemingly impossible (to me, not to Christopher) experiment that begged to be conducted. I realized that if Christopher was neither a delusional schizophrenic nor a pathological liar -- these were two big ifs -- and the findings were positive, the experiment held the possibility of becoming one of the more remarkable investigations in the history of contemporary parapsychology, and perhaps even of science in general. I subsequently learned that Christopher could be unreasonably suspicious at times -- no doubt because of his dangerous work as an undercover agent and his extraordinary sensitivity as a psychic. </p><p> Four months later, in early August 2001, Christopher arrived from England and set up temporary residence in a Tucson hotel. I had by then selected twenty possible locations in southern Arizona -- from Nogales, a Mexican border town, to Summerhaven, a ski resort on the top of Mount Lemmon. Of these twenty locations known only to me, ten would be selected at random for us to visit on ten successive days. </p><p> I printed out the name of each site on a sheet of paper, placed each sheet in a separate envelope, sealed the envelopes, and shuffled them, then shipped them overnight to my friend and coauthor Bill Simon, who had agreed to help in the experiment. He acted as an intermediary, receiving the package and turning it over to a third party whose identity was unknown to me. </p><p> The third party was instructed to open the package, shuffle the envelopes, number them, and store them in a safe place; all of this was to be done in front of a video camera. </p><p> For thirteen years Chris Robinson had been recording his nightly dreams and premonitions in a diary -- his "dream diary." Since the previous May, anticipating the experiment that he and I had been discussing, Chris recorded his dreams for ten nights about what he thought he would do and see on each day in Tucson. He repeated this ten-night pre-experimental dream sequence in June and again in July. When he arrived in Tucson in early August, he brought the three sets of ten-day dream diaries with him. I read the diary with its predictions, still believing this part of the experiment to be preposterous and fully expecting that nothing would come of it. Even by my adventurous standards, it simply seemed impossible that he could have guessed locations anything like the ones we would visit on each day of the experiment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> THE "TEN DAYS IN ARIZONA" EXPERIMENT </p><p> In his hotel across the street from the University of Arizona, Christopher got ready for bed on the night before the first day of our experiment. Before falling asleep, he would ask the universe, in his head, to be shown in his dreams where he would be taken the next day. </p><p> As was his ritual, when he awoke, he wrote careful notes in his diary about the dreams he'd had, often including sketches or diagrams. On the first morning -- Thursday, August 2, 2001 -- the experiment officially began when I arrived, about 9 A.M. As we said our good mornings, I set up my digital video camera and videotaped the pages Christopher had written, while he read the raw information out loud onto the audio track. On camera, he then summarized the key information from the three pre-experiment dreams for that day. After that, he described the previous night's dreams. And then, the key part, he concluded by summarizing from the dreams his description of things he believed we would see or experience during that one day. </p><p> On the first day, Robinson focused on "holes, lots of holes," along with "a basin empty of water." With the camera still running, I then placed a call to Bill Simon in southern California to tell him we were ready to learn the location for the day. Bill then contacted the third party. (He didn't have to go far; I would learn after the experiment that this mysterious third party was Bill's wife, Dr. Arynne Simon.) With her video camera running, she opened the envelope that was at the top of the stack after her shuffle, which she had marked as Envelope #1. She read out loud what was written on the paper: "Desert Museum/Animals." She showed the paper to the camera and to Bill, who then called me back and told me the location. </p><p> I did not tell Christopher where we would be going, nor did I tell Bill what Christopher had dreamed. But I knew the desert museum well: a place with a huge variety of holes, ranging from human caves and large animal cages in the ground to prairie dog tunnels in every direction. Even before Christopher and I packed our assorted video and still cameras and began to drive out of Tucson in the direction that would take us to the museum, I knew that his prediction of "holes, lots of holes" was a remarkably apt description of the landscape of the museum. Also, the museum was located in a basin that millions of years ago had been an ocean. </p><p> Christopher's dreams for each day included information not just about the site but also about objects and events on the journey to the location. Hence we carefully monitored the journeys as well as the sites. </p><p> For example, on Day 2, Christopher said that the primary themes of his dreams were "shops and workshops . . . fabricating things . . . metal." The secret message in the envelope for that day sent us to Tubac, an artists' colony, to a specific shop displaying metal sculptures, and with a workshop in the back. On Day 4, Christopher said that the primary themes of his dreams were "suns, mirrors, LCDs, telescopes, Mount Olympus [after his 35 mm camera], airplanes, hangars, a pitched propeller." The site for the day was Kitt Peak National Observatory, situated on a mountaintop and housing the world's largest solar telescope. Returning, we stopped for lunch at one of the only places available on that mountain road -- a general aviation airport, where we of course saw hangars; as decoration, the airport restaurant featured prominently out front a large pitched propeller! </p><p> The post-location information was extra -- not part of the main experiment. However, it turned out that the "extra" information was also extra in the sense of being truly "extra-ordinary." The late Carl Sagan was fond of saying, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." Sagan's slogan, which has become one of the mantras of my Human Energy Systems Laboratory, occurred to me often during those ten days. </p><p> It turned out that there were degrees of extra-ordinariness in the findings from this ten-day experiment. The results every day proved extraordinary, but some days proved to be beyond extraordinary; I want to share with you two in particular -- chosen partly because they are typical, partly because they are profound, and partly because some of the story is playful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> A REPRESENTATIVE DAY -- FROM THE BORDER </p><p> TO THE "SPIRIT OF GOD" </p><p> Day 5 started with Christopher listing the highlights from his previous night's dreams, informed by observations from his prior Day 5 dreams collected at his home in May, June, and July. </p><p> He had dreamed of men holding up traffic. This scene was set somewhere near a border, he said, taking for granted it was the Mexican border, not far from Tucson. He also saw a large water or gas tank. He had dreamed of boats, many boats, and of a car with four flat tires. He had written in his dream journal that the car had no "oil" and then he added "mineral oil." He also saw an embassy in London. </p><p> He dreamed of tires piled high along a chain-link fence, and had ...</p></p><h2>With Us Today</h2><p>The years following the Second Vatican Council have witnessed a crisis of faith in Christ Jesus&#39; Real Presence in the Eucharist. Lacking the faith that Jesus is truly, physically present in the Eucharist, Catholics today are often unable to understand the purpose of the Mass and of the ordained priesthood. Fr. Hardon discusses the serious implications of this decreasing faith in the Real Presence and how it is linked to the crisis in the priesthood today.</p><p>John A.

And yet, addiction found him.<br><br> More than 2.5 million Americans are addicted to opioids, some half-million of these to heroin. For many of them, their drug addiction leads to lives of demoralization, homelessness, and constant peril. For parents, a child&#x2019;s addiction upends family life, catapulting them onto a path no longer prescribed by Dr. Spock, but by Dante&#x2019;s <i>Inferno</i>.

Yet menstruation is still seen by many as a mark of shame. We are told not to discuss it in public, that tampons and sanitary pads should be hidden away, the blood rendered invisible. In many parts of the world, poverty, culture, and religion collide, causing the taboo around menstruation to have grave consequences. Younger people who menstruate are deterred from going to school, adults from work, infections are left untreated. The shame is universal and the silence a global rule.&nbsp;<br><br> In <i>It&#x2019;s Only Blood</i> Anna Dahlqvist tells the shocking but always moving stories of why and how people from the United States to Uganda, Sweden to Bangladesh, are fighting back against the shame.</p><p><b>Anna Dahlqvist </b>is a journalist specializing in women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; rights.

King Frederick William of Prussia had recently acquired from Sweden this chilly gray town at the mouth of the River Oder, planning to develop it as a port for Berlin. Sophie's father, Christian August von Anhalt-Zerbst, had command of the garrison there. A man of solid virtues -- a sense of duty, order, discipline, thrift, integrity, piety and a totally practical approach to life -- he was promoted to governor of the town, and the family moved into the forbidding ducal castle, a sixteenth-century building of Harz granite. Here, in this cheerless town swept by winds from the Baltic, Sophie spent her first thirteen years.</p><p>In 1742, Christian August succeeded his cousin as ruler of Anhalt-Zerbst, 150 miles southeast of Stettin, in the heart of Germany. Since the house of Anhalt did not conform to the laws of primogeniture, he was obliged to share the sovereignty with his brother. Catherine wryly observed in her memoirs, "All Anhalt princes had the right to share; they have shared so much that there is almost nothing left to share."</p><p>Anhalt-Zerbst, though an independent principality for over 500 years, possessed no more than 20,000 inhabitants. Yet, as a foreign visitor observed at the time, "They live in a land of milk and honey; indeed these were the only people, considered as a state, whom before or since that time I have ever heard talk without complaining." The rich soil produced wheat, hops, potatoes, flax and tobacco. Deer and wild boar roamed the forests and the rivers were well stocked with salmon. The silk brocades produced in the principality, often flowered in gold or silver on a clear ground, were considered among the finest in Europe. Zerbst was also famous for its brewery and produced excellent beer. Christian August was devoted to the welfare of his people and greatly impressed his daughter as a ruler.</p><p>As a result of her father's new status, Sophie was now heiress in her own right to the domain of Jever in Lower Saxony. Although she was always described as coming from modest origins in comparison with the grandeur she was to come to know, Sophie's background was not without a certain style and glamour. Three or four months of the year, from her eighth to her fifteenth year, Sophie accompanied her mother to stay with the Duchess of Brunswick-Luneburg, where they attended balls, operas, hunts and dinners, met countless foreign visitors and took part in the etiquette of a well-organized court. Nor was her mother without useful family connections. The daughter of the Lutheran bishop of L�beck, she was a member of the younger branch of the ducal house of Holstein and her brother had been chosen to marry the daughter of Peter the Great of Russia, the Grand Duchess Elizabeth. Although he had died before the marriage took place, Elizabeth never forgot her tall, handsome fianc�, and Sophie's mother never let pass any chance of fostering this relationship with the woman who, in 1740, was crowned Empress Elizabeth of All the Russias.</p><p>This was an era when every European court tried to imitate Versailles. Sophie was given a French Huguenot governess, Babet Cardel, who succeeded in inspiring her charge with a love of French language, drama and literature. Even when she was Empress of Russia, Sophie took pride in signing her letters to Diderot and Voltaire "the pupil of Babet Cardel." She remembered Babet as "patient, gentle, gay and lovable," a teacher with "a natural spiritual quality." Later, when she wanted people to forget that she was a German, she would speak to them in French.</p><p>As a girl Sophie displayed the same solid, serious virtues as her father along with the far more superficial flair and charm of her mother. Little Sophie was intelligent, lively, gay, mischievous, boisterous, relatively healthy and impudent, as well as having an instinctive love of learning and a thirst for knowledge. Although considered too thin, she always carried herself well, giving the impression of being above medium height. She possessed a natural sense of style and elegance, a mass of dark chestnut hair, sparkling blue eyes and a captivating smile with perfect teeth. Describing herself as a girl, she recalled, "I was never beautiful -- but I pleased."</p><p>Few could have forecast the extraordinary future ahead. Baroness von Printzen, lady-in-waiting at the tiny court of Anhalt-Zerbst, who had been present at Sophie's birth, had watched her grow up and became her trusted friend, wrote, "I would never have guessed that she would become as famous as she did," adding that "Only through error, whimsy or flippancy could she have been called outstanding or brilliant.</p><p>"In a word," she observed candidly, "I got the impression of quite an ordinary person." But what the baroness also noticed was Sophie's ambition, noting that even as a girl she had a serious, cold and calculating mind. And as Sophie wrote of herself at this time, "I used to tell myself that to be 'something' in this world, one needs the qualities which this 'something' demands. Let us look seriously at our little inner self. Do we have these qualities or do we not? If we do not, we will develop them." Babet Cardel described her as an <i>esprit gauche</i> (perverse spirit), a mind ripe for an outside influence to give it direction. That influence was to be Russia.</p><p></p><p><b><i></i></b></p><b><i>The Journey</i></b><p>On New Year's Day 1744, a letter arrived in Zerbst marked "Secret and Confidential." Inside was an invitation from the Tsarina Elizabeth Petrovna to Her Highness the Princess Johanna Elizabeth and her daughter to come to Russia as soon as possible. Although no reason for this request was given, Sophie's mother knew exactly what it meant. Elizabeth had never married and was looking for a bride for her nephew and heir. A second letter confirmed her judgment. It came from King Frederick in Berlin and urged her to accept the tsarina's invitation in the interests of Prussia.</p><p>Sophie's father had been completely excluded from these intrigues. As a loyal subject he offered no opposition to the plan, yet it was with genuine regret that he allowed his daughter to leave -- the fate of German princesses married in Russia in the past was not the future he wished for Sophie.</p><p>The princess and her party travelled incognito in the depths of winter, and there was little to alleviate either the boredom or the discomfort of the journey. It took six weeks, and Sophie long remembered her feet swelling so much that she had to be lifted in and out of the carriage. Often they travelled at night, and when they did stop at an inn it was rarely better than peasant lodgings, with little heat and no privacy.</p><p>But as soon as they reached Russia, the nightmare was over. At Riga, their incognito discarded, they received a royal welcome. The empress had sent a squadron of cavalry to escort them, grand lords and ladies to attend them, and magnificent rooms in the castle were prepared for them. Johanna Elizabeth forgot that these honors were in fact for her daughter, and from this time Sophie's real isolation began. Neglected and ignored by the one person she knew in this strange place, the future Catherine the Great hereafter kept her own counsel and relied on her inner strength. Outwardly she must have been a most unprepossessing sight to the bejeweled and gold-braided courtiers who attended her. Pale, thin and simply dressed, she passed by almost unnoticed.</p><p>They journeyed on to St. Petersburg in an imperial sledge, "scarlet, and decked with gold, and lined inside with sable." These sledges (which had been invented by Peter the Great) were pulled by six horses, and Sophie and her mother were able to lie down full length on piles of silk and satin cushions, sable rugs pulled up to their chins. So great was the contrast with the first part of their journey that Sophie instantly fell under the spell of Russia -- a devotion that was to last all her life.</p><p></p><p><b><i></i></b></p><b><i>Russia</i></b><p>Her first sight of St. Petersburg revealed a city still under construction, and the only large stone building was its formidable fortress. Everywhere she came across scaffolding, hammering and noise. Yet although Petersburg was Western in appearance, fundamentally its character was Russian, utterly different from Zerbst with its medieval town hall and Gothic churches. For the rest of her life Sophie was to prefer St. Petersburg to Russia's ancient capital, Moscow. But at Moscow the tsarina was awaiting them. There, on the eve of the Grand Duke's birthday, Sophie was to undergo her first test: to meet her future husband under the watchful eye of the Empress Elizabeth.</p><p>When Sophie and her mother reached Moscow, the city was bedecked for the birthday celebrations of the Grand Duke, with Chinese lanterns and illuminations lighting up the golden domes of a thousand churches. This was a world where luxury and squalor existed side by side, whose values and standards were totally alien from those of the strict Lutheran society in which she had been brought up. Gossip and scandal, gambling, immorality and excesses of every kind -- all covered by a veneer of piety -- constituted the normal behavior of society. But Sophie had tired already of her Lutheran upbringing. She kept a German Bible, marked in red ink where as a child she had learned verses by heart. She had firmly decided that Martin Luther was a boor who (as she put it) "did not teach anybody anything."</p><p>Before the German princesses had time to change, Elizabeth's nephew the Grand Duke was announced, eager to see his future bride. If the fourteen-year-old girl was taken aback by the sight of this spotty, malformed youth, she gave no outward sign. As she wrote later, "I cared very little for the Grand Duke, but I cared ...</p></p><h2>Predict the Next Bull or Bear Market and Win: How to Use Key Indicators to Profit in Any Market</h2><p>The secrets to making money--no matter what the market conditions!<br>An introductory guide to investing, <i>Predict the Next Bull or Bear Market and Win</i> shows you how to build your wealth and protect your investments in an ever-changing market.

In the first collective biography of both the men and women of the Yamato Dynasty, the Seagraves take a controversial, comprehensive look at a family history that crosses two world wars, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the American occupation of Japan, and Japan&#x2019;s subsequent phoenix-like rise from the ashes of the Second World War. <b>The Yamato Dynasty</b><i> </i>tells the story of the powerful men who have stood behind the screen&#x2013;the shoguns and financiers controlling the throne from the shadows&#x2013;taking readers behind the walls of privilege and tradition and revealing, in uncompromising detail, the true nature of a dynasty shrouded in myth and legend</p><p>Most Westerners will know next to nothing of the Yamato, Japan's current imperial family. Neither do most Japanese. Much of Japan's modern history has been erased from postwar textbooks, and a whole generation has grown up knowing nothing of the Rape of Nanking, Pearl Harbor, the Second World War death camps, and countless other atrocities. All that remains are Hiroshima and Nagasaki, symbols of Japan's eternal innocence. <p> Sterling and Peggy Seagrave correct these falsehoods and expose the collusion and corruption that have been at the heart of the postwar Japanese economic miracle. And far from being a symbolic reminder of an ancient past, as the Japanese royal family is sometimes portrayed, the authors point out that it has been at the epicenter of venality and cruelty. Prince Chichibu, Emperor Hirohito's brother, turns out to have masterminded Golden Lily, the systematic looting of every country Japan occupied in the prewar years. Prince Yasuhiko was the brains behind the Rape of Nanking. And dear old Hirohito was so hands-on during the war that he could have halted Pearl Harbor. Moreover, the royal family was so comfortably in bed with the <i>zaibatsu</i>, the corporate ruling elite, that it made a fortune out of the war while the rest of the nation starved.</p> <p> That none of this has come out before is only partly due to Japanese revisionism. We, too, have to share the blame. We had the evidence to try some of the imperial family as war criminals, but we chose not to. The Seagraves' book makes uncomfortable reading for all concerned. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"The Seagraves have uncovered one of the biggest secrets of the twentieth century"<br>--Iris Chang, author of <b>The Rape of Nanking </b><br><br>"[<b>The Yamato Dynasty</b>] dramatically brings the imperial family&#x2013;and those behind it&#x2013;to life, offering readers an intriguing glimpse behind the long-maintained veil of secrecy."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</p><h2>The Etched City: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Combine equal parts of Stephen King&#x2019;s Dark Tower series and Chine Mi�ville&#x2019;s <i>Perdido Street Station, </i>throw in a dash of Aubrey BeardsleyandJ.K.

Bishop's impressive first novel, <i>The Etched City</i>, draws deep from the well of dark fantasy to create a bruised and battered realm which invites comparison with Stephen King's Dark Tower series and China Mieville's twisted imaginings. <p> Set first in the dustbowl wasteland of the Copper Country, Bishop introduces the battlefield sawbones Raule and her gunslinging companion Gwynn. The duo's relationship of necessity is cemented as they flee the justice of "The Army of Heroes," a force created to put down a rebellion in which they were active participants. Wanted and destitute, they make for the uncharted Telute Shelf to find new lives amid the sprawling metropolis of Ashamoil. Gwynn's ruthless knack for violence sends him to the top of the town as an enforcer for the Horn Fan Cartel and its bustling slave trade. Raule, meanwhile, heads to the bottom where she tries to erase her brutal past through ministrations to the city's forsaken. Between the opposite poles of Gwynn and Raule is a languid tale wandering through a sideshow menagerie of lovelorn mobsters, debased priests, brutal imperialists, sorcererous drug dealers, gangland warlords, and otherworldly artists that deftly examines the nature of violence, compassion, spirituality, redemption, and reality. --<i>Jeremy Pugh</i></p>Gwynn and Raule are rebels on the run, with little in common except being on the losing side of a hard-fought war.

Then they shift around awkwardly, muttering apologies, and I have to assure them it&#x2019;s okay, it&#x2019;s fine, don&#x2019;t worry!<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, that&#x2019;s not at all what happened today. But usually that&#x2019;s how it goes: silence, shuffling, sorry, okay.<br> &nbsp;<br> It came up more when I was younger, before I learned to steer the conversation away at any hint we might be heading in that direction. Sisters, siblings, death? Find the nearest exit, please. In first grade when we were learning graphing, Ms. Murphy told us to stand up when she got to how many siblings we had. Zero? One? Two? Chairs scraped the floor as kids stood up and sat back down, with Ms. Murphy count�ing. I raised my hand to ask, &#x201c;What if I have a sister, but she&#x2019;s dead? Is that a zero or a one?&#x201d; Poor Ms. Murphy wasn&#x2019;t sure either. She said, <i>Um, oh, it&#x2019;s, oh, ah, your choice? </i>Then she blinked very many times and erased that graph and switched to: <i>How many teeth have you lost? </i>That night, she called my par�ents in for a conference to discuss what had happened and to apologize to them. They explained why I had seemed so factual about the situation, so Ms. Murphy wouldn&#x2019;t think I was a scary unfeeling loon, and comforted her. She retired the next year.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mom says it definitely wasn&#x2019;t because I had trauma�tized her. <br> &nbsp;<br> But Mom is like that, very supportive. Always on my side. Never gets mad. <br> &nbsp;<br> My dad doesn&#x2019;t get mad either, actually. To be fair, he seems generally pretty unemotional about anything that&#x2019;s not the outer planets. <br> &nbsp;<br> Except when it comes to the subject of Bret. Just the men�tion of my sister&#x2019;s name makes both Mom and Dad kind of jolty, though they attempt to hide it. Now that I&#x2019;m almost fourteen, I try not to bring up Bret anymore. You know how if you drop something on the subway tracks, you have to just leave it? You can maybe still see it, your bead necklace or phone or whatever, but too bad; you can&#x2019;t ever get it back. That&#x2019;s kind of what the topic of Bret is like for us at this point. <br> &nbsp;<br> But today it came up at Monday-out-day lunch, while AJ Rojanasopondist was insisting that his brother Neal must&#x2019;ve stolen his permission slip. Which didn&#x2019;t make any sense, ob�viously. Why would adorable little Neal want to steal AJ&#x2019;s permission slip?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a conspiracy,&#x201d; Emmett explained, in solidarity with his best friend. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; AJ insisted. &#x201c;Neal is evil.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Emmett smiled at that. He has the most genuinely happy smile. It takes over his whole face. <br> &nbsp;<br> Before lunch, Mr. Phillips had snapped his fingers and told AJ, in front of the whole class, that if he didn&#x2019;t get his parents to deliver a signed permission slip by the end of the day, he wouldn&#x2019;t be allowed to go on the trip tomorrow to the concert at the cathedral. So AJ spent the whole lunch period pleading with his mom on Emmett&#x2019;s phone (AJ&#x2019;s phone was dead, as usual) while simultaneously shoving three slices of pizza into his mouth, practically whole. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>AJ Eating </i>should be its own channel on YouTube. Every�body would watch it. I&#x2019;m not kidding; it&#x2019;s seriously that good. The guy barely has to chew. <br> &nbsp;<br> He and Emmett had taken the other two chairs at the table where Sienna and I were in Famiglia, so it&#x2019;s not like we could politely not listen to AJ trying to convince his mom that little Neal must have stolen the permission slip out of his binder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He just wants to mess me up constantly,&#x201d; AJ complained to us after he said <i>good-bye</i>, <i>thanks</i>, <i>I love you </i>to his mom, and handed Emmett&#x2019;s phone back. We all threw out our used plates and napkins. Sienna and I walked out with them into the sunshine of Broadway and stopped in front of the big group of Loud Crowd kids who were stalled there. &#x201c;Neal may look sweet,&#x201d; AJ continued. &#x201c;But he is actually a demon child.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Emmett, whose older sister, Daphne, is quiet and studious, said, &#x201c;Ugh, demon siblings are the worst.&#x201d; Then he looked at me apologetically, realizing. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you love permission slips?&#x201d; I asked, to get off the sibling topic. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hate them,&#x201d; AJ said. &#x201c;Permission slips are my enemy.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gracie loves <i>permission slips</i>?&#x201d; Riley Valvert asked, rolling her pretty blue eyes toward her Loud Crowd friends about how lame I am. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so sad.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Permission slips are amazing,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are you kidding?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Riley looked blankly back at me. She is basically never kid�ding, so, fair point. Riley is in the Loud Crowd, but despite how beautiful she is, they don&#x2019;t seem to like her very much. If she weren&#x2019;t so nasty, and so pretty, I&#x2019;d feel sorry for her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I love that my parents have to sign a crumpled scrap of paper,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;And then just that little nothing, which I fully could have forged, gives teachers legal cover to ditch school with us to go do some random nonschool thing. How is that not amazing?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good point,&#x201d; Beth chirped. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Beth&#x2019;s best friend, Michaela, agreed. She was holding hands with David. They&#x2019;ve been going out since the end of seventh grade. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wait, Gracie&#x2014;you can forge signatures?&#x201d; AJ asked me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My own parents&#x2019;, sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Yours, not so much.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But maybe you could try&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It <i>is </i>kind of random,&#x201d; Emmett interrupted. &#x201c;Permission slips, and off we go?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right?&#x201d; I seconded. &#x201c;I want to marry permission slips.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ew,&#x201d; Riley said, rolling her eyes again, this time to Michaela, who shrugged. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So do I,&#x201d; Emmett said. I love Emmett. He is simply the best. He helps everybody out. &#x201c;We could have a double wed�ding.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; I agreed.</p><h2>Crackers in the Glade: Life and Times in the Old Everglades</h2><p><p><i>Crackers in the Glade</i> is a visually stunning account of bygone days in the Everglades. The largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the United States, the Everglades hold a unique place among all the world&#x2019;s wetlands. Through his writings and illustrations, fisherman, guide, and self-taught artist Rob Storter transports us to the remote, half-wild frontier of southwest Florida in the early part of the twentieth century. There, the events of a day could range from a hurricane to a face-to-face encounter with a panther to the arrival of the latest packet from Key West.</p><p>As Storter recalls his travels through the great swamp and its estuaries, he imparts an old-timer&#x2019;s grasp of the fantastic array of plant and animal life the Everglades once supported. Looking back over a life closely linked to the water, he chronicles how mechanized methods eclipsed the more sustainable approach of fishing as the livelihood of locals who were attuned to natural cycles and worked by necessity on a small scale.</p><p><i>Crackers in the Glade</i> is also a story of family and community, of daily joys and setbacks. Here, Marilea Storter&#x2019;s recollections, some of which are included in the book, add depth and detail. By turns the family doctor, cook, teacher, and moral anchor, Marilea held husband Rob and their children together through times when the best house they had was a tent and medical care consisted of castor oil and prayers.</p><p>Rob Storter knew the Everglades before commercial fishing, real estate development, drainage projects, and tourism changed the region forever.

It requires acceptance of the premise that evil spirits exist and can invade, control, and impair the health of an individual and that the individual can, in turn, be cured through someone forcing the evil spirits to leave. &#34;For the vast majority of biblical scholars,&#34; asserts Graham H. Twelftree, &#34;this is tantamount to believing in such entities as elves, dragons, or a flat earth.&#34; But for Christians throughout the worldespecially the developing worldexorcism is an important part of the freedom that can be had through faith. In the Name of Jesus is the only book that explores this common part of ministry in the early church. This reliable and historical discussion provides church leaders, Bible students, pastors, and scholars with an intriguing and unique resource.</p><p>Although the Synoptic Gospels treat exorcism as a significant aspect of Jesus's ministry, other parts of the New Testament say little to nothing about exorcism. Which is more reflective of early Christian belief and practice? Graham Twelftree explores this debated issue by examining exorcism in the New Testament world and studying all relevant New Testament passages.<br><br>"Graham Twelftree has proved himself, by several top-level monographs, as the expert of the day in his cautious, meticulously detailed examination of Jesus as an exorcist and miracle worker. He now judiciously extends the examination to the early church's view and practice of exorcism from Paul through to the Greek Apostolic Fathers. There is no better, nor even comparable, treatment. This will dominate a generation of study."--<b>Max Turner</b>, London School of Theology<br><br>"Contemporary accounts of exorcisms abound, but there has been very little written on the practice from a rigorous biblical and historical perspective until now. <i>In the Name of Jesus</i> fills this gap and provides the reader with numerous helpful insights into the text of Scripture and into the practice of the church in the second century. This book is exceptionally well researched and will prove to be an indispensable source for biblical scholars as well as anyone interested in the theme of spiritual warfare. I cannot think of anyone better suited to write this volume than Dr. Twelftree."--<b>Clinton E. Arnold</b>, Talbot School of Theology<br><br>"For over two decades Graham Twelftree has closely studied the question of exorcism. This stimulating and graciously provocative work is essential reading for anyone working in the field."--<b>Rikk Watts</b>, Regent College<br><br>"In this excellent book, Graham Twelftree describes the place and practice of exorcism among the early Christians. He discusses Jesus as an exorcist, the way exorcism does or does not feature in the various strands of the New Testament, and exorcism in the second century in both Christian texts and those of their critics. His balanced and insightful scholarship will be of immense value to scholars and students alike. This book will make a major contribution to this important but comparatively neglected area of study."--<b>Paul Trebilco</b>, University of Otago<b>Graham H.

Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.' &#x2015;Sherlock Holmes </p><p>Many of the greatest British crime writers have explored the possibilities of crime in the countryside in lively and ingenious short stories. <em>Serpents in Eden</em> celebrates the rural British mystery by bringing together an eclectic mix of crime stories written over half a century. From a tale of poison-pen letters tearing apart a village community to a macabre mystery by Arthur Conan Doyle, the stories collected here reveal the dark truths hidden in an assortment of rural paradises.</p><p>Among the writers included here are such major figures as G. K. Chesterton and Margery Allingham, along with a host of lesser-known discoveries whose best stories are among the unsung riches of the golden age of British crime fiction between the two world wars.</p></p><p><p><strong>MARTIN EDWARDS</strong> is an award-winning crime writer best known for two series of novels set in Liverpool and the Lake District. He is a series consultant for British Library Crime Classics, Chair of the Crime Writers' Association, and President of the Detection Club. <em>The Golden Age of Murder</em>, his study of the Detection Club, was published in 2015 to international acclaim, and won the Edgar, Agatha, H.R.F. Keating and Macavity awards for the year's best book about the genre.</p>Thirteen short stories, mostly written between the two world wars, reveal the dark side of life in the English countryside. The earliest entries revolve around the fair of face and strong of limb, each with a signature detective who effortlessly unravels a not very knotty puzzle. In M. McDonnell Bodkin's "Murder by Proxy," "young, handsome, debonair" Eric Neville advises his equally attractive cousin John to wire Mr. Beck in London to help discover who shot their uncle, Squire Neville, at his Dorset estate. In G.K. Chesterton's "The Fad of the Fisherman," Horne Fisher solves the murder of Sir Isaac Hook at his West Country manor house. In E.C. Bentley's "The Genuine Tabard," Philip Trent helps George D. Langley, "the finest-looking man in the room," expose a dodgy deal. Perhaps the best of the early puzzles is Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Black Doctor," in which Mr. Humphrey comes to the aid of a landowner accused of murdering his neighbor. The fun doesn't really start, though, until Margery Allingham unmasks the shady side of the Garden Field competition at the village flower show in "A Proper Mystery." Gladys Mitchell adds her take on the perils of Morris dancing in "Our Pageant." The indomitable Sgt. Beef solves the murder of an elderly spinster in Leo Bruce's "Clue in the Mustard." And Ethel Lina White offers a chilling tale of a damsel in distress in "The Scarecrow." But far and away the funniest take on country manners is Leonora Wodehouse's mordant "Inquest," which turns murder into suicide into murder. A volume that may not persuade readers that there's menace in every meadow but certainly shows that English crime isn't confined to the Smoke. (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>This is a marvellous collection of short stories from the Golden Age of British crime fiction. This selection of stories contains work by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Gladys Mitchell, G K Chesterton, Anthony Berkeley and H C Bailey among others....The theme of this collection is murder in a rural setting. My particular favourite in this collection are E C Bentley's 'The Genuine Tabard' - which doesn't include a murder but is definitely worth reading for the sheer delight of the story. I also enjoyed 'The Gylston Slander' by Herbert Jenkins - poison pen letters; and 'The Naturalist at Law' by R Austin Freeman....All the stories in this collection are well worth reading and some will remain with you long after you have finished reading the book. In my opinion this is on of the best short story collections in this excellent series. (<i>Jillysheep</i>)<br><br>It is a great pleasure when a fan is able to discover a new and not-yet-read story from mystery fiction s Golden Age (roughly the first half of the 20th century). The print and e-book publication of Serpents in Eden: Countryside Crimes, an anthology of lesser-known stories by some of the era's most talented writers, is the latest release from The Poisoned Pen Press and the British Library Crime Classics series, allowing readers everywhere to discover these stories anew....Serpents in Eden is edited by Martin Edwards, a prolific writer and mystery literature historian, and he appears to be the perfect candidate for the job. Edwards shows clear love for and knowledge of his field, and every story in the collection highlights those crimes and misdemeanors that can take place in an otherwise idyllic and deceptively safe country setting. This simple thematic link and a natural one, both literally and figuratively, for a genre that has long found menace and shadows in rural isolation, from the Gothic secrets of Jane Eyre to Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes adventure "The Copper Beeches" lets the stories resonate and speak to one another in appealing (and cumulatively sinister) ways....At least three authors take advantage of their settings to deliver brief, vividly comic sketches of their country characters. Margery Allingham's group of Essex farmers discussing the prospect of foul play and sabotage at a gardening competition are full of life and truly of the soil; her 1942 story "A Proper Mystery," which was previously uncollected, incorporates wonderful, concise local color. Leo Bruce uses his short tale to present the unadorned and earthly and very likable Sergeant Beef, who would never be comfortable in a Metropolitan crime squad but who is more than capable of recognizing a "Clue in the Mustard." And my favorite author Gladys Mitchell (see my tribute website at www.gladysmitchell.com) delivers a short study of a rivalry among Morris dancers in "Our Pageant," the concluding story in the collection....Other authors wisely make their idyllic surroundings an essential part of the mystery. H.C. Bailey, an underrated Golden Age author and creator of Reggie Fortune, sets "The Long Barrow" in Dorsetshire, where an archaeologist and his secretary may or may not be up to something more deadly than excavating ancient burial sites. R. Austin Freeman's story "The Naturalist at Law" is especially intriguing as an example of early forensic research as Dr. Thorndyke investigates a drowning in a ditch. And with "The Fad of a Fisherman," G.K. Chesterton presents a tale not featuring Father Brown, but up to that philosopher s clever paradoxical standards of a government official found dead beside a country stream....E.C. Bentley spins a curiously comical story of fraud committed at a vicarage in "The Genuine Tabard." Anthony Berkeley Cox's "Direct Evidence" is intriguing both for the author's winking tone towards the genre one character notes, for example, that it is "quite unthinkable that the brother of a girl who could play tennis like that should have committed a murder" and when contrasted with an alternate version of this story. ("Double Bluff," with a different murderer and outcome, appears in the Cox collection The Avenging Chance and Other Stories published by Crippen &amp; Landru.) And Arthur Conan Doyle has a story here, "The Black Doctor," which was written during his Sherlock Holmes years but does not feature the master detective. The events focus on the trial of a man accused of murdering a dark-skinned physician raised in the Argentine Republic but now practicing medicine in a quiet English village. The absence of Holmes doesn't hurt the story, but a revelation that strains credibility is a bit more damaging. The approach is very explanatory and testamentary, as befits the late Victorian literary style, but the story still engages....Another pleasure with a collection like this is the potential for discovering writers previously unknown to one. There were four here whom I had not read before, and I don't think I will be actively seeking out their work, even though the samples here are competent. Best in show is Ethel Lina White's melodrama "The Scarecrow," concerning an escaped psychopath and an isolated farmhouse: the plot moves along and, like any good thriller writer, she knows which details to provide and which to hold back. Less memorable are "The Gylston Slander" by Herbert Jenkins (a successful publisher in his day job) and "Murder by Proxy" by M. McDonnell Bodkin, a story which suffers from an over-obvious murderer and a questionable alibi method. And Leonora Wodehouse, step-daughter of Plum, contributes "Inquest," a well-written and somber story about the poisoning of a patriarch, the judicial investigation that follows, and a chance encounter on a train with two of the drama's participants years later....If you're a fan of classic detective mysteries, you will thoroughly enjoy Serpents in Eden. Reading these unfamiliar stories written by some of the most creative minds of the era is like sampling the delights of an assorted box of chocolates, some lighter and sweeter, some darker and sharper, but all good. Just don't trust the chocolates if it is Mr. Anthony Berkeley Cox who passes them to you. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Throughout December, I enjoyed reading a book called Silent Nights. The carefully chosen collection from the Golden Age of British crime fiction was perfect for such a busy month, as the stories were short and complete with plenty of detail and nicely wrapped up endings....This is the second book of short stories I have read from the same time period. This selection of stories have a rural theme and contains works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Gladys Mitchell, G K Chesterton, Anthony Berkeley and H C Bailey among others....If you like mysteries, I am sure you will find this book as enjoyable as I have. (<i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>This genial anthology contains 13 stories with rural English settings written over half a century or so, many during that golden age of crime fiction between the world wars. The solution of "The Black Doctor," a non-Holmes story by Arthur Conan Doyle, depends on what today's readers would consider a cheap trick, but which was probably quite novel when it appeared in 1898. The lush style of M. McDonnell Bodkin's "Murder by Proxy" nicely conveys an earlier era. Thus a character is "radiant in white flannel, with a broad-brimmed Panama hat perched lightly on his glossy black curls." And when was the last time you heard a cornered murderer exclaim, "Curse you, curse you, you've caught me"? A couple of selections hinge on information that is likely to be of significance only to natives of England, and others require a classical education heavy on Greek and Latin. Still, this volume is bound to please fans of traditional mysteries. (Mar.) (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>This book should perhaps be read as a companion to Murder at the Manor; set in the country but with the murders taking place out of doors. In his introduction, Martin Edwards quotes Sherlock Holmes famous dictum (from The Copper Beeches), that there is more evil undetected in the countryside than in the city. Hence the title: murder in Eden destroys what should be a rural idyll. Again, many of the authors are well known. Conan Doyle appears, with a non-Holmes story and we have G K Chesterton and Margery Allingham, too. I liked the Dr Thorndyke mystery, by R Austin Freeman (must read more of these) and another scary one from Ethel Lina White. I'm usually disappointed when I find a book consists of short stories but these detective ones work well and are just the right length to read while having a cup of tea. What could be cosier? I enjoyed the country house book more than this one, but it's still worth reading. Another book in the British Library Crime Classics series (lovely cover!), which will be out next March. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Serpents in Eden is another excellent entry in the British Library Crime Classic series. Collecting short stories from around a fifty year time span, the book demonstrates what a perfect place the country is for crime. Set in the British countryside, the stories are by such familiar luminaries as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and G.K. Chesterton as well as formerly popular but now almost forgotten authors like H.C. Bailey, Anthony Berkeley, and R. Austin Freeman. What the collection does, collectively, is remind readers how elegantly constructed a mystery can be. There is not a one of these that is not a sleek, honed work of art....It also brings to light new old stories: Without a collection like this, it is unlikely most readers would ever see "The Naturalist at Law" by R. Austin Freeman, and that would be a crying shame. The story makes great use of misdirection, small clues, and its country setting. In fact, I'd challenge anyone to find a more country story than this. "The Genuine Tabard" by E.C. Bentley is not only little known but entirely British; even after the solution is explained to the American tourists, it is hard for an outsider to grasp. Even the better-known detectives are well-served by this collection. G.K. Chesterton is well known, but "The Fad of the Fisherman" is very little collected and it makes solid use of the company of many-motives and an intelligent, sharp-eyed sleuth very different from Father Brown. "A Proper Mystery" by Margery Allingham has never been collected before, and it looks with a mix of humor and affection at the effect a seemingly minor crime can have on a community. The other stories are similarly well-chosen examples of the theme....Serpents in Eden gives readers a chance to revel in good, old-fashioned, puzzle mysteries and the myriad ways they are told. It's a perfect book for mystery aficionados to take with them on a vacation or to curl up with on a weekend. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Serpents in Eden: Countryside Crimes is another selection in the British Crime Library Classics series. I knew that this was a selection of short stories, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the crimes within these pages are not all murders....I've said it before, so here it is once again&#x2015;short story collections are a great way to discover "new" authors, and this collection contains some gems. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Thirteen short stories all set in the English countryside. Quiet, peaceful, idyllic countryside and the most twisted of crimes....All very good authors of crime stories and all with a twist in the tale! Very interestingly put together and told (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Edwards provides both enthusiastic introductions and careful selection of stories, some old favorites and some neglected but well worth reading.

He awakes to find himself naked, alone, and forty-eight million miles from Earth&#x2014;a castaway on the dying planet Mars. Taken prisoner by the Tharks, a fierce nomadic tribe of sixlimbed, olive-green giants, he wins respect as a cunning and able warrior, who by grace of Mars&#x2019;s weak gravity possesses the agility of a superman. He also wins the heart of fellow-prisoner Dejah Thoris, the alluring, red-skinned Princess of Helium, whose people he swears to defend against their grasping and ancient enemy, the city-state of Zodanga.<p></p><p>John Carter first appeared in 1912 in the pages of <i>The All-Story </i>magazine and immediately entered the dream-life of American readers young and old. He was Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x2019;s favorite among his many creations and remains a favorite of lovers of science fiction and fantasy everywhere. On the occasion of John Carter&#x2019;s centenary, The Library of America invites readers to rediscover <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, the adventure-pulp classic that gave the world its first great interplanetary romance.</p></p><p>Although Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) is justifiably famous as the creator of <i>Tarzan of the Apes</i>, that uprooted Englishman was not his only popular hero. Burroughs's first sale (in 1912) was <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, opening the floodgates to one of the must successful--and prolific--literary careers in history. This is a wonderful scientific romance that perhaps can be best described as early science fiction melded with an epic dose of romantic adventure. <i>A Princess of Mars</i> is the first adventure of John Carter, a Civil War veteran who unexpectedly find himself transplanted to the planet Mars. Yet this red planet is far more than a dusty, barren place; it's a fantasy world populated with giant green barbarians, beautiful maidens in distress, and weird flora and monstrous fauna the likes of which could only exist in the author's boundless imagination. Sheer escapism of the tallest order, the Martian novels are perfect entertainment for those who find Tarzan's fantastic adventures aren't, well, fantastic enough. Although this novel can stand alone, there are a total of 11 volumes in this classic series of otherworldly, swashbuckling adventure. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>This book is a large print version using a minimum of 16 point type in a 6 by 9 inch size and library bound.

The word &#x2018;virtue' came to English from Latin, via Old French, and while it has acquired a moral valence, the word in its earliest uses gestured toward a magical or transcendental power, a power that might be embodied by any particular substance or act. With vices I am not concerned. Unlike the short-term history of taste, which is fueled by reprimand or correction, the history of art moves from achievement to achievement. Contemporary embodiments of poetry's virtues abound, and only our devotion to a long history of excellence allows us to recognize them." &#x2013;from James Longenbach's preface</p><p><i>The Virtues of Poetry</i> is a resplendent and ultimately moving work of twelve interconnected essays, each of which describes the way in which a particular excellence is enacted in poetry. Longenbach closely reads poems by Shakespeare, Donne, Blake, Keats, Dickinson, Yeats, Pound, Bishop, and Ashbery (among others), sometimes exploring the ways in which these writers transmuted the material of their lives into art, and always emphasizing that the notions of excellence we derive from art are fluid, never fixed. Provocative, funny, and astute, <i>The Virtues of Poetry</i> is indispensable for readers, teachers, and writers. Longenbach reminds us that poetry delivers meaning in exacting ways, and that it is through its precision that we experience this art's lasting virtues.</p></p><p><b>James Longenbach</b> is a poet and critic. He is the author of <i>The Art of the Poetic Line</i> and several other critical works, as well as four collections of poetry, including <i>The Iron Key</i>. He is Joseph Henry Gilmore Professor of English at the University of Rochester.<p>&#x201c;[Longenbach] slices open poems with such grace, care and erudition that they aren't lessened by the dissection. . . . Predicated on the simple and elegant thesis that good poetry transcends trends, the book points to paired poetic 'virtues' like excess and restraint or compression and dilation, and then shows how they work in harmony to make poetry sing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;How can we ask our poets both for careful technique and for wild surprise? How can we even talk about poetry in general--how it works, what makes it good, how to read it--if the best poems stand apart from all rules, all programs? . . . Never too academic, Longenbach introduces not just great writers, but ways to think about them, ways to see how their works confront death, pursue self-doubt, and overcome their own initial limits.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly, starred review</i></p><p>&#x201c;[<i>The Virtues of Poetry</i> is a] rewarding guide that can help us all more fully read poetry and appreciate its intricacies and its 'virtues.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness for Readers</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Longenbach is] interested, among other things, in the moment of takeoff, that moment when language ceases to be simply a vehicle for meaning and in a poem becomes something more like us: alive, always moving from discovery to discovery and anchored by an infinite, unplumbable hope. . . . These essays are, by turns, beautiful, witty and wise and in the end they'll (hopefully) leave you better equipped to experience and enjoy great poems.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Star Tribune (Minneapolis)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Longenbach's own great stylistic virtue is lucidity; his writing educates without obfuscating or condescending. . . .

One of the chief virtues of [Longenbach's] new book is its inclusiveness.

But all that will change in a heartbeat . . .</p><p>The nightmare is awakened when third-grade schoolteacher Lois Larkin takes the children on a field trip to Bedford. There in the abandoned woods, a small, cruel boy unearths an ancient horror&#x2014;a contagious plague that transforms its victims into something violent, hungry . . . and inhuman.</p><p>The long, dark night is just beginning. And all hope must die as the contagion feeds&#x2014;for the malevolence will not rest until it has devoured every living soul in Corpus Christi . . . and beyond.</p></p><p><p>Sarah Langan received her MFA in fiction writing from Columbia University. She studied with Michael Cunningham, Nicholas Christopher, Helen Schulman, Susan Kenney, and Maureen Howard, among others, all of whom have been instrumental to her work. The author of <em>The Keeper</em> and the Bram Stoker Award-winning <em>The Missing</em>, she is a master's candidate in environmental medicine at NYU and lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> In her second novel, Langan delivers a powerhouse creepfest that recalls, in the best way possible, the early work of Stephen King. Corpus Christi, Maine, was once a town of affluence, but since the mysterious paper mill fire in the neighboring town of Bedford (depicted in last year's well-received debut, <i>The Keeper</i>) released dense sulfuric clouds that killed the surrounding forest, Corpus Christi has been in steady decline. When fourth-grade teacher Lois Larkin takes her class on a field trip to the now-abandoned Bedford, they're exposed to a deadly virus that transforms the infected into ravenous, flesh-eating monsters. Rather than stick to zombie lit convention (mindless undead, endless chases), Langan invests her plague with a sinister intelligence of unknown origin, maintaining a skin-crawling tension as the vivid cast of characters succumb to murderous insanity, hunting down and tearing apart animals, neighbors and loved ones. Langan has the control of a pro, parsing just enough horrific details to allow the truly gruesome scenes to play out unbound in the imagination; this solid sophomore effort proves that <i>The Keeper</i>'s disturbing ability to burrow into readers' heads and stay there was no fluke. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Miami for a friend's wedding, Regan acquires a new friend in the bride's uncle, Richie Blossom, who has invented "run-proof, snag-proof" pantyhose. If Richie can sell his patent to a manufacturer, he'll have the funds to buy the retirement home where he and his friends live. A year earlier, the residents acquired an option on the home from Dolly Twiggs before she died under suspicious circumstances; now the option is about to expire, and if Richie's endeavor fails, the extremely valuable property goes on the open market. Meanwhile Ruth Craddock of Calla-Lilly Hosiery, who has her hands on a pair of the prototype pantyhose, realizes that Richie's invention could put her out of business. When an aggressive driver nearly mows Richie down, Regan appoints herself his protector and determines to learn more about what happened to Dolly. Although Regan gets the job done and is generally pleasant company, her gripes about such trivial matters such as hotel-room hangers and health-food aficionados occasionally make her seem a whiny sort of lass.

This long-awaited work provides identification keys for Kentucky&#39;s 2,600 native and naturalized vascular plants, with notes on wildlife/human uses, poisonous plants, and medicinal herbs. The common name, flowering period, habitat, distribution, rarity, and wetland status are given for each species, and about 80 percent are illustrated with line drawings. The inclusion of 250 additional species from outside the state (these species are &#34;to be expected&#34; in Kentucky) broadens the regional coverage, and most plants occurring from northern Alabama to southern Ohio to the Mississippi River (an area of wide similarity in flora) are examined, including nearly all the plants of western and central Tennessee. The author also describes prehistoric and historical changes in the flora, natural regions and plant communities, significant botanists, current threats to plant life, and a plan for future studies.

Damiana is a Safe-Keeper, whose job is to listen to the secrets people confide in her and then to keep them to herself. She lives with her daughter, Fiona, and Reed, whom readers are told was a foundling. Others in the village also have special gifts including being a Dream-Maker and a Truth-Teller. The story portrays rural village life with a strong, loving extended family. However, everything changes for the young people when, at 15, they are sent to spend the summer with Damiana's sister. Reed lives with a merchant who gives him some experiences in his trading business while Fiona studies with a herbalist to learn the art of healing. On their return home, they find that their mother is dying. Before she dies, Damiana shares a secret with Fiona that she pledges to keep secret until the time she knows it is right to tell. Fiona takes on the role of Safe-Keeper but finds that this is not her true calling. Shinn writes well and has created a variety of interesting characters. The unraveling of a family secret at the end comes as a complete surprise, but rather than adding to the story, it feels a little like a cheat. Still, this does not detract significantly from the story.<i>&#x2013;Jane G.

In his historical studies of the intersections of race, settler colonialism, and slavery, in his major essay (with Elizabeth Esch) on race and the management of labor, in his detailing of the origins of critical studies of whiteness within Marxism, and in his reflections on the history of solidarity, Roediger argues that racial division is part of not only of the history of capitalism but also of the logic of capital.</p><p><b>David Roediger </b>is the Foundation Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at Kansas University.

Incisive, provocative, and uncannily timely, <i>Class, Race, and Marxism</i> reckons honestly with the challenges of building class solidarity across the fissures of race, the difficulties of writing about it, and the ways in which the two are entwined. If there is a single lesson here, it is that solidarity is not forever&#x2014;it is elusive, fragile, and hard as hell.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Robin D.G.

Deepening poverty and accelerating ecological destruction challenge us to act with wisdom and maturity: How can we move toward a future where meaning, hope, and beauty can truly flourish? <p>Drawing on insights from economics, psychology, science, and spirituality, The Tao of Liberation seeks wisdom leading to authentic liberation a path toward ever-greater communion, diversity, and creativity for the Earth community. It describes this wisdom using the Chinese word Tao both a way leading to harmony and the unfolding process of the cosmos itself.</p></p><p>"The Tao of Liberation is a path-breaking book. It brings together the insights of cosmology, ecology, and spirituality in a fresh and powerful way. With their creative collaboration, Mark Hathaway and Leonardo Boff offer us a remarkable new synthesis which will surely become an enduring classic." ;--Brian Swimme, Director, Center for the Story of the Universe, California Institute of Integral Studies. <p>"I love this book. Its inspiration lives up to its ambition - leading the reader through some of the most complex issues of our age (from globalization and the current recession to climate change and loss of species) while illuminating a path forward through religion and spirituality. Having had the great privilege of serving on the Earth Charter Commission with Leonardo Boff, it was not a new idea that our values and our faith have immediate relevance to the current interlocking web of crises in which we find ourselves. Together he and Mark Hathaway have written a transcendent work of eco-liberation and planetary survival." --Elizabeth May, O.C., Leader, Green Party of Canada </p><p>"There is no other book that has so carefully identified the new cosmology of Thomas Berry and Brian Swimme as a liberating context for a sustainable future. This is a masterful and important work." ;--Mary Evelyn Tucker, Forum on Religion and Ecology, Yale University </p><p>"The Tao of Liberation is a monumental contribution toward tackling the global crisis, including analyses that plumb the roots of the crisis and proposals for a fundamental change of direction. The text draws on science, economics, ethics and spirituality, integrating them in a scenario that just might pull us back from the precipice." --David G. Hallman, Advisor to the World Council of Churches Climate Change Programme </p><p>"A sweeping, comprehensive and poetic manifesto of social and ecological change, as viewed through the eyes of a prominent liberation theologian in partnership with a hands-on spiritual change activist. They weave a vision of not only cultural change, but also spiritual transformation through a renewed, and renewable, relationship with the entire network of creation." --Neil Douglas-Klotz, author, Prayers of the Cosmos </p><p>"Leonardo Boff and Mark Hathaway give birth to a great marriage between liberation theology and creation spirituality. I welcome it--it is very timely--and I welcome the dimensions of ecology, cosmology and feminist philosophy applied astutely to the crisis of western capitalism and culture we are all undergoing at this time as well as the deep ecumenism which is so beautifully and aptly invoked in the use of the great Tao Te Ching throughout the text." --Matthew Fox, author, The Coming of the Cosmic Christ </p><p>"Global poverty and global ecological destruction represent two of the most important challenges facing the human community. In The Tao of Liberation, Mark Hathaway and Leonardo Boff creatively and movingly explore the interconnection of these twin challenges, deftly blending the wisdom of the world's spiritual traditions and the insights of social science to explore the structural and cultural features underlying our present unsustainable behavior. This is a must read for all of those who seek to understand the critical nexus between the option for the poor and the option for the Earth." --Stephen Bede Scharper, University of Toronto </p><p>"Drawing on compelling inter-disciplinary resources, Boff and Hathaway present us with a holistic, comprehensive, and integrated path toward the transformation required if the human experience is to have a future in our Earthly Home. The crisis we face is spiritual, and the 'The Tao of Liberation' is an exciting challenge we ignore at our peril."--Rev. Bill Phipps, Co-founder, Faith and Common Good network </p><p>"As we reach a crossroads in the history of humanity, readers will find in this book a wealth of ideas and deep insights about the fundamental shift in human consciousness and the radical transformations in our world that are now required. Among all these ideas, the most important and profound, perhaps, is the one at the very center of the authors' endeavor. Rather than seeing the transition to a sustainable society primarily in terms of limits and restrictions, Hathaway and Boff eloquently propose a new and compelling conception of sustainability as liberation." --Fritjof Capra, author, The Tao of Physics </p><p>"The Tao of Liberation is a seamless and creative gospel for our time. Through a vital and integral synthesis of wisdom both ancient and new, Mark Hathaway and Leonardo Boff craft a prophetic and timely work to address new challenges before us. Their guide to an ecology of transformation is a source of inspiration, engagement and hope for all who search for a comprehensive vision, and a new era of healing for earth and its peoples." ;--Jim Conlon, author, From The Stars to the Street </p><p>"The Tao of Liberation...is lucid and inspiring, making connections between cosmology and ethics, science and spirituality, whole systems theories and consciousness - and explains how these insights, when united, point the way for us to join together in the struggle to renew the Earth." ;--Heather Eaton, co-author, Ecofeminism and Globalization</p><b>Mark Hathaway</b> is an adult educator who researches and writes about the interconnections between ecology, economics, social justice, spirituality, and cosmology.

Walter Claireborne Rawley, renowned nationwide as "Walt the Wonder Boy," is a Saint Louis orphan rescued from the streets by a mysterious Hungarian Jew, Master Yehudi, who teaches Walt to walk on air. Master Yehudi brings Walt into a Kansas circus troupe consisting of Mother Sioux and Aesop, a young black genius. The vaudeville act takes them across a vast and vibrant country, through mythic Americana where they meet and fall prey to sinners, thieves, and villains, from the Kansas Ku Klux Klan to the Chicago mob. Walt's rise to fame and fortune mirrors America's own coming of age, and his resilience, like that of the nation, is challenged over and over and over again.</p><p>Paul Auster is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The New York Trilogy</i>&nbsp;and many other critically acclaimed novels. He was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize in 2006. His work has been translated into more than forty languages. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Auster (Leviathan, 1992, etc.) departs from his usual cerebral fiction for this quick trip into Doctorow Land--a mytho-historical tale that invokes the American '20s, complete with glamorous gangsters and legendary sports stars. Writing in his anec-dotage, the septuagenarian Walter Rawley recalls his moment of fame back in his youth when he toured the country as ``Walter the Wonder Boy,'' a freckle-faced bumpkin who could walk through the air. Walter's levitations were no sham, but a carefully nurtured talent developed by the mysterious Master Yehudi, a Hungarian Jewish impresario who discovered Walter on the streets of St. Louis at age nine. ``A pus-brained ragamuffin from honky-tonk row,'' the orphaned Walter eventually submits to Yehudi's grueling regimen. Yehudi's household on the Kansas prairie harbors other outcasts also: Mother Sue, a stout Sioux who once performed in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show; and Aesop, a precocious crippled black foundling admitted to Yale. Yehudi and Walter finally take their show on the road after their house is visited by the KKK, who lynch Mother Sue and Aesop. Walter's fame grows rapidly. ``In the arms of the great ambient nothingness,'' he floats above ground, astounding audiences from coast to coast. His career is interrupted by a ghost from his past, a mean-spirited uncle who wants some of the loot. Then disaster strikes: The onset of puberty destroys his gift. Life after that is never the same. Yehudi shoots himself. Walter becomes a gangster in Chicago; develops a bizarre obsession with the great pitcher Dizzy Dean; and slowly fades away into alcoholic obscurity before recovering and writing this tale. Despite intimations of allegory and parable, Auster's dizzying trip through the century is not nearly as dimensional as Moon Palace, his previous escape from the metaphysical rigors of his shorter works into the picaresque.

There's St. John's Wort (also called hypericum), which has proven effective in combating depression; gingko biloba, a circulation-enhancer that retards Alzheimer's and other age-related memory problems; grapefruit fiber, which combats cholesterol; and many others. All of the compounds and alternative treatments listed in <i>Miracle Cures</i> are regularly practiced in Europe, Asia, or both. So why aren't they used in the United States? Carper points out that since "nature owns the patent," there's little financial incentive for American pharmaceutical companies to investigate natural compounds. Secondly, most American doctors are simply unaware of the testing that has been done on these techniques; most research has been done by non-English speaking physicians and written up in foreign journals. Responsibly toting up the risks and benefits of each, Carper is hoping for a sensible integration of natural remedies into American medicine.Nationally syndicated columnist and America's leading authority on health and nutrition, Jean Carper now turns her attention to the public's increasing demand for medically proven natural cures. The first comprehensive guide to fully document the effectiveness of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other natural substances, <i>Miracle Cures</i> is backed by the latest scientific findings of leading scientific institutions, research centers and medical journals, including the<i> New England Journal of Medicine</i> and the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association.</i> <p> Written in the same lively style that has made Jean Carper's previous bestsellers so accessible, <i>Miracle Cures</i> also includes awe-inspiring cases of medically verified natural cures.

In fact, "the new volume is in every way a continuation of <i>Areas of My Expertise</i>, except in the ways it's clearly superior." (<i>The Onion AV Club</i>)</b><br><br> In 2005, John Hodgman published his first compendium of Complete World Knowledge, <i>The Areas of My Expertise</i>, a handy volume of fake trivia and made-up facts. Hodgmania was born. Virtually overnight, John Hodgman was whisked from tweedy obscurity to the high ether of minor celebrity. And from his strange new vantage point as a Famous Minor Television Personality, Hodgman realized that there is some world knowledge yet to be documented. And so he returned to exactly where he had left off&#x2014;namely, page 256 of the paperback edition of <i>The Areas of My Expertise</i>. And he brought with him: <i>MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU REQUIRE.</i> Which, naturally, begins on page 257. Like its predecessor,<i> More Information Than You Require</i> consists of brief articles, overlong lists, frighteningly complex charts, and beguiling narratives on new and familiar themes such as:<br><br> THE PAST (because there is always more of it) <br>THE FUTURE (because they say there is still some left) <br>MOLE-MEN (including a list of 700 Mole-man names) <br>GAMBLING, THE SPORT OF THE ATHSMATIC MAN (including hermit crab racing) <br>CRYPTOGEOGRAPHY (including Canada) <br>HOW TO BE A FAMOUS MINOR TELEVISION PERSONALITY (Hint: Go on television) <br><br>AND NOW, the relatively pocket-sized and inexpensive paperback edition includes even <i>more.<br><br>MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU REQUIRE</i>, updated to include the very latest in implausibility.<br><br> PLUS!: This paperback edition includes a special self-expanding fold-out edition of THE TAXONOMY OF COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE, which you have probably never seen before because it has been carefully hidden. UNTIL NOW.<br><br><b>Look out for John Hodgman's latest book,&nbsp;<i>Vacationland</i>, available from Viking in Fall 2017.</b></p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2008</b>: While writer and former literary agent John Hodgman had a considerable cult following before the publication of his first book, <em>The Areas of My Expertise</em>, the exact moment when Hodgmania hit fever pitch can be traced to his November 16, 2005, appearance on <i>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</i>, when a "Famous Minor Television Personality" was born. Since then he has welcomed a new level of visibility as the Resident Expert on <i>The Daily Show</i>, appearing as the PC in the ubiquitous "Get a Mac" ads, and in bit roles in movies and on TV, so the world should be primed to embrace <i>More Information Than You Require</i>, Book Two in his Compendium of Complete World Knowledge (or, as it says on the cover, "New Ferret, Same Old Con"). Fun facts, bizarre trivia, and oddball photos ("Figure 51: Jane Addams, Pre-Antlers") are crammed into every corner of the page with extended riffs on How to Tell the Future Using a Pig&#x2019;s Spleen, What to Expect While Serving as a Juror, Gambling ("Sure Thing Number Three: <i>Star Wars</i> Slots"), How to Deal With Some Common Infestations, and of course, How to Be Famous. And what he did for hobos in <i>The Areas of My Expertise</i>, celebrating their free spirit and conniving ways (and a list of 700 hobo names), Hodgman does for mole-men, the "race of humanoids who live in the complex warren of tunnels and vast caverns beneath the earth." Did you know, for instance, that Thomas Jefferson uncovered on his "mole-manic palace known as Monticello" a "small group (or 'Parlor') of mole-men dining on weevil pie and discussing world affairs... 'They touched my face,' wrote Jefferson, 'and hissed, as is their custom.'" Naturally there are 700 Mole-Man Names and Occupations included ("No. 281: Mr. Wallow Dripstone, a worm rider"). Hodgman may be up to the same old con, but this brand new ferret of a book is a wise (and wise-ass) little predator who will swindle away your reading time with endless hours of rabies-free laughs. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i><b>John Hodgman</b>&nbsp;is a writer, comedian, and actor.

The sickness is a strange one, affecting only the adults and none of the children, and soon Neil finds himself an orphan once more.<br><br>Alone, Neil travels to London in search of other survivors of the plague. There he finds a strange world of fear and suspicion, where friends can be enemies and people will do anything to survive. In this time of strife, amid the excitement and loneliness of his solitude, can Neil find a way to focus on what matters most?</p><p>John Christopher was the pseudonym of Samuel Youd, who was born in Lancashire, England, in 1922. He was the author of more than fifty novels and novellas, as well as numerous short stories. His most famous books include <i>The Death of Grass</i>, the Tripods trilogy, <i>The Lotus Caves</i>, and <i>The Guardians</i>.Empty World <br> <br>1<br> <br>THEY WERE DRIVING ALONG THE motorway on a bright sunny morning, everyone happy. While Neil&#x2019;s father drove, his mother was telling him something about a dance at the golf club. Amanda and Andy were arguing, but amiably, about a pop programme they had watched on TV. Grandpa and Grandma were admiring the countryside, he pointing out a view that attracted him and she agreeing. Neil himself was silent, engrossed in a strange but satisfying feeling of well-being. He tried to work out what had given rise to it, but could not. It being end of term, the try he had scored in the junior House final, the prospect of summer and the cricket season ahead? Or perhaps just this journey.<br> <br>He could not decide, but it did not matter. He was relaxing in the enjoyment of that, too&#x2014;it not mattering&#x2014;when he heard his mother&#x2019;s small gasping cry and looked up to see it: the monstrous hulk of the heavy lorry and trailer jack-knifing across the road in front of them, looming up and up. . . . Then screams, and blackness, and he woke up sweating, his fingers digging into the bed clothes that were wrapped tightly round him.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Neil thought about the dream later that day, as he walked across the churchyard on his way to catch the bus to school. It had been full of inaccuracies and impossibilities, the way dreams were. Not a sunny morning, but a dull rain-bleared afternoon. Not a motorway, but the A21, a few miles south of the Tonbridge bypass. And, of course, Grandpa and Grandma had not been there. The Rover was a roomy car, but not that roomy; and besides, the object of the journey had been to spend the weekend with them at Winchelsea.<br> <br>But the rest&#x2014;his mother&#x2019;s soft cry, the sight of the monster twisting incredibly across their path . . . was that the way it had been? He had no way of knowing, no recollection of the time between setting out from the house in Dulwich and waking in a hospital bed with a nurse, young, dark and pretty, bending over and smiling and telling him he was all right, and not to worry. He had wondered what she was talking about, and asked what he was doing there; and she had told him again not to worry about anything but to lie back and rest, and he would have visitors very soon.<br> <br>Neil walked through the crumbling stone archway into the empty shell of what had been the nave of the church before it was destroyed in the French wars. That was nearly seven hundred years ago. Winchelsea then had been a thriving town, recently rebuilt here on its hill after the sea swallowed up old Winchelsea&#x2014;like its sister-town, Rye, a brash newcomer to the company of the Cinque Ports and hopeful of outstripping its seniors in trade and prosperity. But the sea which destroyed the first port had capriciously moved away from the second, remaining as no more than a mocking gleam on the horizon.<br> <br>So the hopes had come to nothing, and the traders had gone with the sea. Only a few squares were left of the grid pattern which had made the town a contemporary showplace of planning; and those were occupied by sleepy houses, fronted by lawns and flowers, three or four small shops, a �couple of pubs. There had been no point in rebuilding the nave of the church, and the New Gate, which had marked the southern limits of Winchelsea, and through which one summer morning late in the thirteenth century the French had been treacherously admitted, stood now over a muddy lane, nearly a mile out in the country, surrounded by grazing sheep.<br> <br>There were not many young people in Winchelsea. It was a place for retirement&#x2014;that was why his grandparents had come to live in it. And in the past, although he had liked visiting them, Neil had felt a kind of impatience. Nothing happened here or was likely to happen, beyond the slow change of the seasons. He looked at the white facades of the houses making up the sides of the great square of the churchyard. Even the post-war ones had an appearance of having been there forever.<br> <br>He thought of the dream, and then of Grandpa coming to his bedside in the hospital. He had asked Neil how he was, and nodded when he said he had a headache.<br> <br>&#x201c;A touch of concussion, but they tell me you&#x2019;re sound in wind and limb.&#x201d;<br> <br>His grandfather, a Civil Servant until his retirement, was a tall thin man, with a long face lengthened further by a white pointed beard. Although he liked them both, Neil preferred him to his grandmother because he never fussed and talked directly, paying little regard to differences in age. His manner had always been calm and easy. He was trying to look calm and easy now, but not managing. Neil asked him:<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What have they told you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing. I&#x2019;ve not been awake long.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There was a smash. You don&#x2019;t remember it?&#x201d;<br> <br>His tone was even but Neil was conscious of the strain behind it. He thought of them all setting out together after lunch&#x2014;Amanda insisting on going back to say another goodbye to Prinny, the cat, and worrying in case Mrs. Redmayne might not remember to come in and feed him. . . . He said sharply:<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Mummy? Is she in hospital, too?&#x201d; He realized, for the first time properly, that the other beds in the ward were occupied by strangers. &#x201c;And Amanda, and Andy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all right. Don&#x2019;t worry, Neil.&#x201d;<br> <br>There had been a hesitation, though; very slight, but enough to make the reassurance meaningless. And what he said was meaningless, anyway; because if they had been all right his mother would have been here, beside his bed. He said, hearing his voice echo as though far off:<br> <br>&#x201c;All of them?&#x201d; He stared up at his grandfather. &#x201c;Dad, as well?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all right,&#x201d; his grandfather repeated.<br> <br>He did not need the sight of the tear rolling down the wrinkled cheek to give the lie. Nor did he resent it, knowing the lie was meant to help him, to ease him back into a world that had shattered and changed. But he could not go on looking at another human being. He turned and buried his head in the pillow, immobile, believing and not believing, while his grandfather&#x2019;s voice went on and on and he heard it without listening, an empty noise.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>There were others from the Comprehensive waiting at the bus stop. He knew them slightly, and nodded to one or two, but did not engage in conversation. There had been the curiosity one could expect over a newcomer but he had done little to satisfy it; and when the suspicion which was also inevitable had hardened into something more like hostility, he had not minded.<br> <br>It was a big change from London, and Dulwich College. There had been a talk with his grandfather about that. It seemed the Head had offered to find him one of the few boarding places, and his grand�father had put the proposition to him: he could choose between taking it, and keeping a continuity in school at least, or going as a day boy to the Comprehensive School in Rye.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your home&#x2019;s with us now, Neil,&#x201d; Grandpa had said, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;re very glad to have you&#x2014;glad for our own sakes. But we&#x2019;re old, and a bit dull, and so is Winchelsea. You might find it better to carry on at Dulwich where there are people you know&#x2014;chaps your own age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll stay here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re thinking of the fees, that&#x2019;s not important. You know. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>He said it brusquely. He had heard his grand�parents talking one evening, quietly when they thought he was asleep. There would be a lot of money coming his way. His father, an insurance executive, had himself been more than amply insured. The sole survivor of the family was going to be rich.<br> <br>The new school was very different from the old, but a large part of the difference, he realized, lay in himself. At Dulwich he had made plenty of friends&#x2014;more than Andy who, though a year older, was more reserved. And Andy had not been much interested in sports, while he played most games reasonably well.<br> <br>He had taken part in a couple of cricket games at Rye, and not done badly. But he had kept to himself and the other players, after one or two small overtures, had let him get on with it. It had been the same in school generally. Although it was never mentioned, he guessed the story of what had happened, the reason for his coming here, had got around. He had had one or two pitying glances from girls, and once found a conversation abruptly switched off as he entered a class-room. But no questions were asked, and he volunteered no information.<br> <br>So he had made no friends, but did not mind it; nor did he miss the ones he had left behind. It was not that he brooded over the disaster. It surprised him to what extent he was able to put it out of his mind; and in spite of occasional lurching moments of fear and sickness, he did not feel particularly unhappy.<br> <br>He had an idea it would not have been so easy in London. The impatience he had once felt for the slowness and dullness of the little town had been replaced by a kind of contentment. It was good that nothing happened, and that the most usual sight was of an old man or woman creeping along on some unhurried errand. He liked the quiet empty evenings, with the darkness lit only by chinks of light from cosy sitting rooms, and the single street lamp on the corner.<br> <br>The others who were at the bus stop had collected into a group and were talking and laughing. He did not know what the subject of conversation was, and did not care. He thought of his dream again, and felt sweat cold down his back, but both dream and reality seemed far away. As the bus came growling down the road from Hastings, through an avenue of leafy green, he found himself whistling. He realized it was the tune Amanda had been so crazy about the last few weeks, but went on.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>In general the work seemed easier in Neil&#x2019;s new school, but perhaps because of that less interesting. An exception was Biology, taught by a small stocky man with a Scottish accent and a tendency to range widely round his subject. Today they were dealing with cell structures, and Mr. Dunhill moved on to a discussion of the ageing process. There was some evidence, he pointed out, for believing that ageing was caused by the increasing inability of cells to remember the functions laid down for them in the genetic blueprint, a sort of cellular amnesia.<br> <br>Someone asked if that meant that if something could be done to improve the memory of cells the ageing process could be halted&#x2014;even reversed? Did it mean people might be able to live forever, barring accidents?<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, no, I wouldn&#x2019;t hazard that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Dunhill rubbed his palms together in front of his chest, a characteristic gesture. He went on:<br> <br>&#x201c;But there&#x2019;s an interesting example in the opposite direction, in that epidemic they had in India, a few months back.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Calcutta Plague, it had been called, because that was where the first cases had occurred. It had swept through northern India, killing hundreds of thousands, and then died out. Neil remembered his father and mother discussing it one evening when he came downstairs after finishing his prep. Their preoccupation, he recalled, had given him the chance of slipping out to a friend&#x2019;s house, without their realizing how late it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll remember there were two phases of the disease,&#x201d; Mr. Dunhill said. &#x201c;Initially there was a fever, followed by recovery and a symptomless period varying between ten days and three weeks. That was followed by a general deterioration of bodily functions, leading to collapse and death.<br> <br>&#x201c;The striking thing was that the second phase strongly resembled an accelerated ageing process. It mimicked a rare disorder called progeria, specifically the Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, in which children grow old before they grow up. There was a well-known case of a child in Brazil, who at six months had adult teeth already yellowing, at two years white hair, thinning on top, and who died at ten of hardening of the arteries.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fortunately in this case it was not the young who were affected but the old, chiefly the very old. Mostly the victims were over sixty. There were one or two cases as young as the middle forties, and the results there were much more striking: wrinkling of skin, whitening of hair roots, calcium loss, atherosclerosis. It was as though they were racing towards the grave, instead of indulging in that slow crawl which satisfies us normal geriatrics.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Dunhill was in his fifties. It was probably as much as forty years since he had sat in a class-room, listening to someone as old as he was now. Was the joke about being a geriatric as light-hearted, Neil wondered, as it seemed? People died: he had come to know that in the last few weeks in a way he had never known before. And they must fear it, he supposed, more and more as the inevitability drew closer.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a tenable explanation,&#x201d; Mr. Dunhill went on, &#x201c;that the Calcutta virus attacked the individual cells in such a way as to inhibit or destroy that memory function we have been talking about. The victims quite literally died of nothing except old age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They were old already, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was someone called Barker, a gangling boy with an almost perpetual silly grin. Mr. Dunhill looked at him with distaste.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, they were, weren&#x2019;t they? And they were only Indians, after all. Nothing to cause us concern. Now let&#x2019;s get back to the mechanism of mitosis.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>There was a girl in the class called Ellen, pretty in a fair, frail way. Neil had noticed her chiefly in the company of Bob Hendrix, who was more conspicuous. He was heavily built and had a loud aggressive voice. His hair was bright red, and he usually wore a canary-yellow waistcoat. His father was a prominent Rye tradesman, and he clearly thought deference was due to him on that account.<br> <br>Hendrix went home for lunch but Ellen, like Neil, stayed at school. On this day she sat near him, and made what appeared to be friendly if timid overtures. He answered her civilly, but without enthusiasm. She persisted, though, and afterwards found him and spoke to him more directly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it true?&#x201d; He looked at her. &#x201c;About your family all being killed?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was something he had reckoned on happening but had hoped, with the lapse of time, might not. It was not that he dreaded the reference&#x2014;more a �feeling of embarrassment in advance. Now it had happened, though, he found it did not bother him. She seemed sympathetic rather than curious&#x2014;a nice girl, probably.<br> <br>At any rate, although he did not volunteer much information, he did not snub her. She went on, in a small soft voice, saying what a terrible thing it was, and he found he did not mind that, either.<br> <br>It was something, she said, which had always been a nightmare with her. She had imagined it hundreds of times, and it had pursued her in dreams. She mostly thought of it as happening at school&#x2014;of someone coming in to the class and telling her to report to the Headmaster, of going into his study and seeing his face, much graver than usual. And then being told&#x2014;it was always both of them killed together, usually in a car smash.<br> <br>Once launched she needed no encouragement to go on. She told him about her life at home, and he was a little surprised. She was an only child. Her father, a plasterer, was very strict&#x2014;he did not allow her out later than ten in the evening, half past nine in winter. Her mother, it seemed, was ill a great deal....</p><h2>Shelley&#x2122; Tea Ware Patterns (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>This encyclopedic reference presents thousands of tea ware patterns produced by Shelley Pottery*TM and its predecessors, Wileman &amp; Company*TM and Foley China*TM, of Staffordshire, England, from the 1860s through 1966.

John McPhee chronicles the perhaps unfathomable perseverance of the aircraft's sucessive progenitors.</p></p><p>Since the explosion of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, energy-efficient, lighter-than-air ships have given way to gas-guzzling jet aircraft. But in the 1960s, an unusual band of inventors, engineers and investors, again in New Jersey, created the Aereon, a strange, wingless hybrid airplane/dirigible. The Aereon--the Deltoid Pumpkin Seed-- promised to be a safe workhorse of the skies, capable of carrying the payload of entire freight trains with minimal cost. <p> In this exquisitely crafted tale of back-to-the-drawing-board perseverance, McPhee tells the story not only of the Aereon, but of any product development team. He astutely delineates the team members' personalities and interactions, delves back in time to the origins of lighter-than-air craft and the history of propellers, and in the end, makes us wonder why this promising technology hasn't been perfected. Like <i>Aramis: Or the Love of Technology</i>, this is a splendid book about a potentially superior aircraft which has yet to be adopted.</p><p><b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University. His writing career began at <i>Time</i> magazine and led to his long association with <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he has been a staff writer since 1965. Also in 1965, he published his first book, <i>A Sense of Where You Are</i>, with Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and in the years since, he has written nearly 30 books, including <i>Oranges</i> (1967), <i>Coming into the Country</i> (1977), <i>The Control of Nature</i> (1989), <i>The Founding Fish</i> (2002), <i>Uncommon Carriers</i> (2007), and <i>Silk Parachute</i> (2011). <i>Encounters with the Archdruid</i> (1972) and <i>The Curve of Binding Energy</i> (1974) were nominated for National Book Awards in the category of science. McPhee received the Award in Literature from the Academy of Arts and Letters in 1977. In 1999, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Annals of the Former World</i>. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p></p><h2>The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories (Dover Mystery Classics)</h2><p>"Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer," declared Raymond Chandler of the writer who created Dr. Thorndyke. Known as the father of the scientific detective story, Freeman was a physician who tested his fictional ploys through microscopic and chemical analysis. His tales not only challenged the wits of his readers but also inspired many modern detection methods. <br>This collection presents eight of the most compelling Dr. Thorndyke stories. "The Case of Oscar Brodski," "A Case of Premeditation," and "The Echo of a Mutiny" offer outstanding examples of a form Freeman originated, the inverted mystery. In these tales, the crime and culprit are revealed at the outset; the fascination begins with the entrance of Dr. Thorndyke, who spins a convincing web of evidence from the subtlest clues. "The Mandarin's Pearl," "The Blue Sequin," "The Moabite Cipher," and "The Aluminum Dagger" incorporate scientific detection, featuring details evaluated by the author's characteristic scientific analysis. As a special bonus, this volume includes "31 New Inn," the now hard-to-find tale in which Dr. Thorndyke makes his debut.</p><p>Richard Austin Freeman (1862&#x2013;1943) drew upon his experiences as a colonial surgeon in Africa in the creation of his character Dr. John E. Thorndyke. His first Thorndyke story appeared in 1907, and after serving as an army physician during World War I, he published a tale of the doctor/detective nearly every year for the next three decades.</p><h2>Experiencing the Resurrection Study Guide: The Everyday Encounter That Changes Your Life</h2><p><b>The study guide that will help you experience the powerful reality of Christ&#x2019;s resurrection.

It&#x2019;s a word full of hope, a word that inspires and brings courage to those who know Jesus Christ. He&#x2019;s the risen Lord, in whom all authority has been given in heaven and on earth. And those who are in Christ are in a good place.<br>&#x2014;<i>Experiencing the Resurrection<br></i><br>How do we make the most of this &#x201c;good place&#x201d; that is ours in Christ? What does the resurrection of Christ really mean for us? What does it reveal about the heart and mind of God? And what real differences can the miracle of the resurrection make in the lives of believers today?<br><br>We&#x2019;ll discover answers to those and other questions as we examine God&#x2019;s Word through this companion study guide to the book <i>Experiencing the Resurrection </i>by Henry Blackaby and Melvin Blackaby.<br><br>THE SETUP FOR EACH LESSON<br><br>At the beginning of each lesson, you&#x2019;ll find a list of the chapters in <i>Experiencing the Resurrection </i>that correspond to that lesson. We encourage you to read along in that book as you proceed through this study.<br><br>Throughout this study guide, paragraphs printed in a shaded box&nbsp;(like this one) are excerpts from the book <i>Experiencing the Resurrection</i>. These excerpts can help you focus on that book&#x2019;s most important themes and conclusions. Read them attentively to center your mind on these key points, even if you&#x2019;ve already been through the book.<br><br>Each lesson is structured simply, with a series of numbered questions interspersed with quotations from the book. Sometimes a question will be based on the book quote that precedes it. Sometimes the quote that follows the question will amplify the question&#x2019;s purpose and help you reflect on it even more. Many questions also include Scripture references to look up.<br><br>The last few numbered questions in each lesson will help you summarize what God has been teaching you and respond to Him by obeying what He is showing you to do.<br><br>Each lesson closes with a Scripture passage for meditation and memorization. The lessons in the last half of this study guide tend to be longer than the earlier lessons. At the beginning of each lesson you&#x2019;ll see a suggestion for how many questions to answer daily in order to complete that lesson in a week or less.<br><br>Finally, don&#x2019;t forget that the Holy Spirit is your teacher. Start and end with prayer each time you open this book to work on one of the lessons. Do the same for each group discussion time if you&#x2019;re going through this study with other believers (see the leader&#x2019;s guide at the end of this book).<br><br>You can be confident that as you remain open to the Spirit of God, He will change your mind and your heart by the mighty power of the resurrection of Christ.<br><br>LESSON 1<br>THE RESURRECTION IN THE<br>HEART AND MIND OF GOD<br><br>A companion study to the introduction and chapters 1&#x2013;2 in <i>Experiencing the Resurrection</i>. By answering only three or four questions each day, you can complete this entire lesson in a week or less.<br><br>Without the resurrection, the cross is meaningless....<br><br>The resurrection is proof of Christ&#x2019;s victory over sin and our hope of salvation.<br><br>The resurrection, however, is not a doctrine to be pondered but an invitation to experience the living Christ in your life.<br><br>The resurrection power that raised Christ from the dead, then seated Him at the right hand of the Father and put Him over all principalities and powers, is the same power given to us. Should that make a difference in our lives? Should we be afraid of spiritual warfare? Is there anything we cannot overcome if we&#x2019;re walking with Christ?<br><br>1. In your understanding, what real difference should the resurrection of Jesus Christ be making in your daily life?<br><br>When you become a Christian, you&#x2019;re set in a wholly different dimension in which you can see what others don&#x2019;t see. As Jesus told His disciples, &#x201c;It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given&#x201d; (Matthew 13:11). If you&#x2019;ve been given ability to understand the mysteries of God, are you using your spiritual senses to detect the activity of God? Or do you act like the world, ignoring God until you need Him to bail you out of a crisis?<br><br>2. For your own life, how would you answer the authors&#x2019; questions in the preceding quotation?<br><br>You need to know what God is doing and then make whatever adjustment is needed to participate in His redemptive activity.<br><br>3. As you continue learning from God in this Bible study, are you committed to making whatever adjustment is necessary in your actions and attitudes as you experience God at work in your life? If so, how would you express that commitment personally to God? <br><br>Unfortunately, many Christians are living way below their potential, believing they&#x2019;ll never be anything but ordinary.<br><br>4. In what ways, if any, have you seen yourself as only &#x201c;ordinary&#x201d;? In what ways might this have caused you to be living below your potential? You&#x2019;ve been given the opportunity to function in the realm of resurrection power&#x2014;the most exciting life you could ever imagine. What then could God do in your life if He knew you were wholly yielded to Him? What could He do in and through you if you believed He has already blessed you with every spiritual blessing,&nbsp;delivered you out of the kingdom of darkness, and taken you who were dead in sin and made you fully alive in Christ?<br><br>5. How would you express your answers at this time to the authors&#x2019; questions in the preceding quotation?<br><br>True knowledge of God is always personal, powerful, and life changing....The first step in this journey is knowledge. You must know the truth and understand what God has done in the resurrection. Second, you must believe it&#x2019;s true for your life. The Holy Spirit has been assigned to help you accept the truth as real, by testifying to your spirit that what you&#x2019;re seeing is true. Third, you must receive the truth into your life. It isn&#x2019;t good enough to know the truth or even believe the truth. You must embrace it as yours.<br><br>Last, you must live the truth. That means taking what you&#x2019;ve learned and acting upon it&#x2014;making it a part of your daily life. Move through this entire process, and you&#x2019;ll find new life in Christ&#x2014;a life beyond anything you could imagine.<br><br>6. Think carefully about the process described by the authors in the preceding quotation. How is this process taking place currently in your life?<br><br>When it comes to the resurrection...it&#x2019;s crucial that we understand God&#x2019;s perspective and not try to impose our thoughts upon Him.... The cross was necessary because of the work of sin in our lives. The resurrection was necessary because the cross put Christ to death on our behalf....<br><br>Our need for these acts of God through the gospel is brought home to us through the reality of our guilty conscience and the conviction of our spiritual deadness.<br><br>7. Read through Paul&#x2019;s words in Romans 1:16&#x2013;28. In your own words, how would you summarize what it says about (a) how God reveals His truth to us and (b) what is the essence of that truth?<br><br>In our passage from Romans 1, Paul said three times, &#x201c;God also gave them up.&#x201d; What a tragic statement! He let them be enslaved to what they chose over Him. &#x201c;God gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts&#x201d; (verse 24); &#x201c;God gave them up to vile passions&#x201d; (verse 26); and &#x201c;God also gave them over to a debased mind, to do those<br>things which are not fitting&#x201d; (verse 28). Can you think of a more dreadful state than for God to give us over to that which will utterly destroy us in time and for eternity? God gives us up...and steps back. <br><br>8. In the world around you and in the lives of people you know, in what ways do you see the tragedy of Romans 1:24&#x2013;32 being lived out?<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ is God&#x2019;s clearest revelation of Himself. The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the sending of His Spirit together represent mankind&#x2019;s only hope.<br><br>Although God has revealed Himself in many ways, Jesus Christ is the climax of that revelation.<br><br>9. How have you seen in your own life that Jesus Christ is truly your &#x201c;only hope&#x201d;?<br><br>Sin had to be removed before we could move toward our holy God. Sinful humanity cannot come into the presence of a holy God, so the holy God sent His Son, Jesus, to die on the cross to pay the penalty for your sin. He took your sin and died on your behalf.<br><br>Whereas the cross put to death your old life, the resurrection brings new life. The old life of sin cannot enter a holy place called heaven; new life in Christ is required. And this new life of resurrection power is made a reality for us through the Holy Spirit.<br><br>And here&#x2019;s the most amazing thing about the gospel: the power of the cross and resurrection is just a prayer away. It&#x2019;s that simple. To be simple is not to be shallow or insignificant. To choose Christ is the most profound and substantial decision of your life.<br><br>10. Have you truly made the decision to choose Christ? Do you know Him? And are you seeking to know Him more fully?<br><br>The gospel story defines us as believers. If you don&#x2019;t understand the cross and resurrection, you don&#x2019;t understand the nature of God or what our faith is all about.<br><br>11. How would you define yourself and your own life in terms of the gospel story?<br><br>When we talk of the resurrection, we&#x2019;re looking at something more than a stone rolled away, empty burial wraps, and an angel&#x2019;s proclamation. The cross and resurrection are the heavenly Father&#x2019;s plan to provide salvation for every person who ever walked this earth. It was in His heart from eternity....<br><br>His ultimate answer to the question of sin is found in the cross and resurrection, but He&#x2019;d been working long before then to make us holy.<br><br>12. How do the following passages indicate that the cross and the resurrection were part of the Father&#x2019;s plan in eternity past?<br><br>Acts 2:22&#x2013;24<br><br>Titus 1:2<br><br>1 Peter 1:20&#x2013;21<br><br>Revelation 13:8<br><br>How serious is our sin? Serious enough for the Father to ordain His own Son to die a cruel death in our place.... More than all the atrocities of man, the cruel death of Jesus on the cross tells best how serious sin is from God&#x2019;s perspective.<br><br>13. Think about Jesus as the sacrifice for your sin. With that truth in mind, what is most important for you to know and understand about Him in each of the following passages?<br><br>John 1:4<br><br>2 Corinthians 5:21<br><br>Hebrews 4:15<br><br>Hebrews 7:26<br><br>All sin has always been against God, and He will not dismiss it lightly.... Our sin profanes His name&#x2014;and the world is watching.<br><br>14. What charge did God make against His people in Ezekiel 36:22? Ask Him this: &#x201c;Lord, is there anything in my life that misrepresents You to people who are watching? Has my life become a stumbling block to those who want to know You? Lord, cleanse my life and make me holy before a watching world.&#x201d;<br><br>15. Take time to ask the Lord those questions mentioned in the preceding quotation. What are His answers?<br><br>If you ask the heavenly Father to make you holy before a watching world, He&#x2019;ll turn you to the cross and say, &#x201c;Take a good look. This is My provision for your sin.&#x201d; The Father&#x2019;s plan to remove our sin was the death of Christ; His plan to free us from sin was the resurrection of Christ.<br><br>This was His plan from eternity....<br><br>In the heart of God, the cross and resurrection were planned before all time, and it was out of His heart that the cross and resurrection came into this world&#x2019;s history.<br><br>16. How would you personally summarize the glorious truths mentioned in these passages?<br><br>John 3:16<br><br>2 Corinthians 5:19<br><br>Do you still think of God only as a harsh judge who condemns? Or have you considered the Father&#x2019;s love for you, that He sent His Son to pay the price for your sin?<br><br>17. As you deeply examine your heart, how would you answer the questions raised by the authors in the preceding quotation?<br><br>The Son chose to be obedient unto death.... He left Himself in the hands of the Father with absolute confidence; the promise of the Father would be fulfilled in the resurrection....<br><br>Can you see the eternal purpose of the Father in the death and resurrection of the Son?<br><br>18. As you conclude this lesson, what has God taught you through your study here? What is the most pressing thing He has brought to your heart&#x2019;s attention?<br><br>19. To respond obediently to Him, what must you do at this time? The Son had to die; the Father had to raise Him from the dead.<br><br>FOR MEDITATION AND MEMORIZATION<br><br>That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed<br>to His death, if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.<br><br>PHILIPPIANS 3:10&#x2013;11</p><h2>Family Happiness: Stories (Harper Perennial Classic Stories)</h2><p><p>Russian writer Leo Tolstoy is probably best known to the Western world for his epic WAR AND PEACE and splendid ANNA KARENINA, but during his long lifetime Tolstoy also wrote enough shorter works to fill many volumes.

For seven&nbsp;years, female racers drew large and enthusiastic crowds across the country, including Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and New Orleans&#x2014;and many smaller cities in between. Unlike the trudging, round-the-clock marathons the men (and their spectators) endured, women&#x2019;s six-day races were tightly scheduled, fast-paced, and highly competitive. The best female racers of the era&#x2014;Tillie Anderson, Lizzie Glaw, and Dottie Farnsworth&#x2014;became household names and were America&#x2019;s first great women athletes.&nbsp;Despite concerted efforts by the League of American Wheelmen to marginalize the sport and by reporters and other critics to belittle and objectify the women, these athletes forced turn-of-the-century America to rethink strongly held convictions about female frailty and competitive spirit.<br><br> By 1900 many cities began to ban the men&#x2019;s six-day races, and it became more difficult to ensure competitive women&#x2019;s races and attract large enough crowds.&nbsp;In 1902 two racers died, and the sport&#x2019;s seven-year run was finished&#x2014;and it has been almost entirely ignored in sports history, women&#x2019;s history, and even bicycling history. <i>Women on the Move</i> tells the full story of America&#x2019;s most popular arena sport during the 1890s, giving these pioneering athletes the place they deserve in history.</p><p><b>Roger Gilles</b> is&nbsp;a writing professor at Grand Valley State University.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Gilles&#x2019;s book is a window into a virtually unknown time in women&#x2019;s sports, and it&#x2019;s important because it adds to the history of female athletes who have overcome so many obstacles to be able to compete.

LaFevers, Laura Godwin, and Keith McGowan.In which Ophelia Jane Worthington-Whittard discovers a boy in a locked room and is consequently asked to save the world<br><br> Ophelia did not consider herself brave. She wasn't like Lucy Coutts, the head girl in her grade, who once rescued a baby in a runaway stroller and was on the front page of all the papers. Lucy Coutts had heavy brown hair and pink cheeks, and she called Ophelia Scrap, which made everyone laugh, even Ophelia, to show she didn't mind.<br><br> Ophelia didn't consider herself brave, but she was very curious.<br><br> She was exactly the kind of girl who couldn't walk past a golden keyhole without looking inside.<br><br> The keyhole was in a foreign city where it always snowed. It was on the third floor of the museum, in the 303rd room. Ophelia wasn't at all sure how she got there, only that she let her feet take her wherever they wanted to go.<br><br> Her father had taken a job at the museum. He had become, at the eleventh hour, the curator of Battle: The Greatest Exhibition of Swords in the History of the World. The previous curator had left without warning. In three days, Ophelia's father was to prepare hundreds of swords to be exhibited on Christmas Eve.<br><br> He also hoped that a week in a foreign city would be just the medicine for his daughters. They could explore and ice-skate while he worked. And they would have a white Christmas away from their home, which had grown so quiet.<br><br> He was very busy, though, far too busy to spend much time with them. He told Ophelia she must stay close to her older sister, Alice. But Alice was not interested in seeing any of the attractions. She wanted to go nowhere and do nothing. She wanted to sit all day with her headphones, playing gloomy music and thinking gloomy thoughts. She'd been like that ever since their mother died, which was exactly three months, seven days, and nine hours ago.<br><br> "I'll take you ice-skating later," Alice said, but in a very halfhearted way.<br><br> So, all morning Ophelia had walked alone. She had been upstairs and down. She had climbed in and out of elevators that rattled and creaked between the floors. There were grand galleries filled with priceless treasures and glittering halls filled with dazzling relics. There were precious paintings by the old masters and glorious statues and huge urns, and the ceilings danced with painted angels. Ophelia tried, as hard as she could, to be interested in all these things.<br><br> She leaned her head to one side and nodded approvingly.<br><br> She looked up interesting facts in the rather useless guide.<br><br> She tried to stifle all her yawns.<br><br> But fortunately, these glimmering places also led to murky corridors. And these murky corridors also led to dimly lit rooms. And these rooms contained smaller, stranger collections. And it was these places that made Ophelia's heart beat faster.<br><br> She found a lonely room filled with teaspoons.<br><br> Which led to a room containing only telephones.<br><br> Which led to a shadowy arcade of mirrors.<br><br> She passed through an exhibition of stuffed and preserved elephants. She tiptoed through a quiet pavilion filled with the threadbare taxidermied bodies of wolves. She squeezed through the crowd in the Gallery of Time and saw the famous Wintertide Clock. It ticked so loudly that people had to stick their fingers in their ears. She ran down a long, dim hallway filled with melancholy paintings of girls.<br><br> It was very cold. Windows were left open to stinging sparks of sleet and snow. The wind whistled and moaned through the galleries and down the stairwells. It made the cobwebs on the chandeliers dance.<br><br> Even with a map it was a very confusing place. Signs pointed in the wrong directions, and no one bothered about fixing them. The sign for Porcelains 1700-1850 AD led to Costumes and Culture of the Renaissance. The sign for Costumes and Culture of the Renaissance led to Bronze Age Artifacts. The sign for Bronze Age Artifacts led to an imposing red, locked door.<br><br> There was no point in asking the guards. The guards sat in corners and knitted or dozed. Sometimes, they snarled and yelled like banshees for no good reason, and other times, they let children climb on the glass cabinets, using the brass handles for footholds. Sometimes, they came rushing at people who just happened to stand too long in one place, and other times, they smiled huge toothless smiles and offered old fruit from their large black handbags.<br><br> The museum in the city where it always snowed was the type of place where a person could very easily get lost. Miss Kaminski, the museum curator, had said so herself. Miss Kaminski was dazzlingly beautiful. Her blond hair was tied in an elegant chignon, and she was surrounded by a cloud of heavenly perfume. She had smiled at Ophelia and Alice before placing a perfectly manicured hand on their father's arm.<br><br> "It is advisable that they do not wander alone," Miss Kaminski said. "The museum is very big, and several girls have become lost and never been found."<br><br> But Ophelia didn't feel afraid. It was much better on her own. It was a relief to be out of the workroom, where her father had begun work as soon as they arrived in the city. He was unpacking swords and polishing swords and cataloging swords endlessly. Her father knew everything there was to know about swords. His card read:<br><br> MALCOLM WHITTARD<br><br> LEADING INTERNATIONAL EXPERT ON SWORDS<br><br> "I have a very tight deadline, Ophelia. Christmas Eve!" he said whenever Ophelia tried to talk to him. "I'm sure there are more than enough things here to keep you and Alice occupied."<br><br> If ever you have the chance to visit this museum, the keyhole to room 303 is quite close to a much-celebrated sea monster mosaic floor. It is marked on the maps by an octopus symbol. That first morning, Ophelia spent some time walking on the mosaic waves and the mosaic foam. She traveled the length of all eight glittering tentacles, observed the people falling back from the monster's mouth. She bent over and looked directly into its eye.<br><br> It was the sort of thing her mother would have loved. Ophelia Jane Worthington-Whittard wished more than anything that her mother were alive.<br><br> Near the sea monster mosaic floor, she noticed a gallery with a red rope hung across its entrance. Ophelia slipped under the rope and went inside. It was a small exhibition of broken stone angels. There was no guard in the room, so she touched some wings, even though she knew she shouldn't have. It was very quiet and very still. All she could hear were her own footsteps and her own breathing. It had a peculiar, empty smell. No one had been that way for a very long time.<br><br> In the corner of the room there was a very normal-looking gray door. Above the door were the small silver numbers 302. Ophelia opened it.<br><br> The room behind the ordinary gray door was also almost normal. The floor was checkerboard. The tall windows, with tatty velvet curtains pulled back, gave a view of the city. The sky also was gray.</p><h2>Black Bangor: African Americans in a Maine Community, 1880-1950 (Revisiting New England)</h2><p>Blacks have lived and worked in Maine as early as the seventeenth century, but historically have constituted less than one percent of Maine&#x2019;s population. Probably for this reason, books on Blacks in New England have largely ignored the experience of African American Mainers. Black Bangor is the first major published study of a Black community in Maine.<br><br>This tightly woven case study examines the African American community in Bangor during its heyday, 1880&#x2013;1950, the period that saw an unprecedented migration of Blacks to that city. Blacks migrated to Bangor not just from other New England states, but from the Caribbean and Canadian Maritime Provinces as well, creating a heterogeneous community with roots in two hemispheres. Constituting an &#x201c;ultraminority&#x201d; in Bangor (according to the census, Blacks never numbered more than 300 souls during this period), this diverse community nonetheless came together to establish an impressive range of institutions, including local chapters of the NAACP and Odd Fellows, as well as of Mothers and Junior Mothers Clubs. Concentrated in an area known as the Parker Street neighborhood, Black women in Bangor became domestics and cooks, caterers and beauticians, clerks and stenographers. Men worked as loggers, teamsters, porters, chefs, and barbers; a few owned businesses. <br><br>Organized thematically, with sections on migration, labor, daily life, and community, Black Bangor&#x2019;s topics include not just migration patterns, work, and religious and cultural organizations, but also African American homes, furniture, clothing, and foodways. Elgersman Lee also examines race relations and depictions of Blacks in the local media, and draws comparisons between the experiences of Bangor&#x2019;s African American population and those of Blacks in other New England cities. <br><br>This fascinating and exhaustive study will appeal to anyone from Maine, as well as those interested in African American history and the rich texture of the region&#x2019;s cultural life.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 36MAUREEN ELGERSMAN LEE is Associate Professor of History and Faculty Scholar, African American Collection of Maine, at the University of Southern Maine.

While the United States Army used horse-mounted fighting men from the very beginning, it was in the nineteenth century - from the decade before the Mexican War through the Indian wars - that the dashing cavalry units captured the American imagination.</p> <p>The horse solders remained part of the army until 1943, when the military converted them to mechanized forces. Even so, West Point did not tear down its stables and abandon its riding-proficiency requirement until 1947. The long retention of the cavalry was due to affection for the memory of the glorious role of the cavalry in American military history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Randy Steffen</strong>, who died early in 1977, while these volumes were in production, was born in Maverick County, Texas of part Sioux-Cheyenne Indian descent.

He was awarded a Caldecott Honor for his illustrations in Peppe the Lamplighter by Elise Bartone.In this latest entry in the I Like to Read series, those just beginning to practice literacy skills are entreated to &#x201c;look!&#x201d; at full-page spreads of the activities of some African animals, such as an elephant eating, wild dogs listening, and rhinos napping. After nine such scenes, it&#x2019;s a young boy&#x2019;s turn to play, read, and dream, surrounded by toy versions of each of the creatures mentioned. The figures in the pencil-and-watercolor art are expertly rendered, and each has a light-drenched aura giving the effect of the savanna sun beating down on the animals (although they also feel somewhat washed-out, like an overexposed photo). In addition to this being an introductory zoology lesson (how do giraffes drink water?), many of the animal behaviors&#x2014;drinking, sitting, napping&#x2014;parallel a child&#x2019;s own actions. The sentences of one to three words per spread in a large, clear font and the straightforward text-to-action correlation make for solid and attractive support for very beginning readers in a picture-book format.

Scott examines the history and cultural development of a typical Amish house and barn, one in each of the three largest Amish communities in North America. Home is the center of Amish life and most life events:birth, marriage, daily work and play, retirement, and even death happen there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen Scott explores the history and cultural development of three Amish homesteads, each of which has been occupied by the current family of residence for at least four generations. The Stoltzfus Farm of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the Yoder-Miller Farm of Holmes County, Ohio, the Bontrager-Miller Farm of LaGrange County, Indiana. Amish Houses and Barns also includes a photographic essay of typical Amish architecture in each of the three communities. Its numerous anecdotal stories,"Barn Fire," "The Farm Is Strip-Mined," and "Amish Style Graffiti", enhance the human story.</p><p><br>Stephen E. Scott grew up in southwestern Ohio. He attended the Beavercreek Township schools. Cedarville College, and Wright State University. During a time of spiritual seeking, he attended many "plain" churches, including a variety of conservative Mennonite churches. Scott lived in the Amish and Mennonite community in Holmes County, Ohio, for a year. In 1969 he attended the Numidia Mennonit Bible School in Pennsylvania and the same year began two years of alternate service at Lancaster Mennonite High School in Pennsylvania. During this time, Scott joined the Old Order River Brethren Church, one of the consrvative Anababptist groups. In 1973 he married Harriet Sauder. While working as a researcher and writer for Good Books, he has written Plain Buggies, Why Do They Dress That Way?, The Amish Wedding and Other Special Occasions of the Old Order Communities, and Amish Houses and Barns. He is also the coauthor of Living Without Electricity.<b>Chapter 1 &#x2014; Home: The Center of Amish Life</b><br>The Old Order Amish have no church buildings, no recreation halls, no nursing homes, and no funeral parlors. All the functions of these facilities normally take place in their homes. The Amish world revolves around the home.<br>Although hospitals and modern medicine are used by the Amish people when needed, many Amish women also prefer the warm, familiar surroundings of home for giving birth. Registered midwives and doctors who agree to make home deliveries are patronized. In some Amish communities doctors provide rural, home-like birthing centers for their Amish clients.<br>Most Amish people also prefer to spend their last days in the familiar home environment. Every effort is made to preserve life (although not artificially prolong it), but when death seems imminent an Amish person will usually choose to be with the family at home. While the deceased person is taken to a mortuary for preparation, the body comes back to the home for the viewing and funeral.<br><b>Togetherness At All Cost<br></b>As the institution of the home crumbles in North America, the Amish take great effort to preserve it. Many of the radical nonconformist practices Amish life were instituted to nurture family cohesiveness. The whole idea of restricting mobility by forbidding the ownership of cars is an endeavor to preserve home life. Amish people argue that fast, easy transportation draws family members away from the home.<br>Limited technology within the home further draws the family together and discourages the isolation of individual members. The lack of central heating promotes family togetherness in the few heated rooms in the house. Prohibiting electricity and restricting the number of light sources encourages family life by fostering a central place where all family members spend time reading, working on hobbies, or playing games.<br><b>The Elderly: Needed and Wanted<br></b>The Amish also try to keep the elderly involved in the life of the home. Typically, a small separate house or an addition to the larger house will be built for the grandparents after their children have families of their own. This is the classic <i>Dawdy Haus</i> (grandfather house). In wisdom their quarters have their own kitchens, and the grandparents usually do all of their own food preparation. The Amish realize that parent-child relationships can be strained by the continual presence of grandparents. However, the aged are highly respected and made to feel useful around the farm and home.<br>While an Amish farmer generally hands over responsibility for the farm to the younger generation earlier than normal retirement age, he does not really retire. His help around the farm is both essential and welcome. Often the older family will start a small cottage industry to occupy their time and provide some extra income.<br><b>Home: The Place of Work</b><br>Younger families have also increasingly turned to cottage industries as farmland has become <p>scarce and expensive. These home businesses make it possible for young Amish men to stay at home with their families. They work together with their wives and children in much the same way as they would on a farm. Buggy shops, harness shops, woodworking shops, dry goods stores, and many other businesses typically involve the labor of many members of the family. Many Amish mothers also supplement the family income by producing quilts and other crafts in the home.With the exception of occasional help from Grossmommy next-door, no day care is needed.<br><b>Home: The Place of Worship</b><br>Individual Amish families are directly involved with the life of the church because they take turns hosting worship services in their homes. Each Amish congregation consists of a geographical unit called a "district" which typically includes from 20 to 40 family units. Worship services are held every other Sunday in most Amish communities; thus, a turn comes around no more than once or twice a year. By focusing on the home as the place of worship, the church in Amish society is thought of as a body of believers rather than a building or a place. Each family contributes to the life of the church by providing both a place for meeting and the food for a fellowship meal after the services.<br>Most preparation precedes an Amish church service. The family spends many hours cleaning the house, sprucing up the farmstead, and preparing food. The furniture is removed from several rooms in the house, and simple, backless benches are arranged in closely spaced rows. Some of these same benches are transformed into dinner tables after the church service.<br><b>Home: The Place of Recreation</b><br>On a different level, the home is also the scene of evening social activities among Amish young people. Traditionally, unmarried young folks have gathered around tables in living rooms and kitchens to sing hymns on Sunday evenings. Depending on the mind-set of the particular youth group, the gatherings occasionally are not so docile.<br>Courtship also takes place at home. A young Amish man typically has a date at his girlfriend's home after the Sunday evening singing. In some communities Saturday night is also a time for dating. Although the dating couples meet in the home, they are normally secluded from other members of the family, spending their time together in the formal parlor after the rest of the family has gone to bed.<br>One of the few major functions of life that does not take place in the home is school. However, even in this case the schools are small, one-room buildings maintained and managed by the Amish community. They are usually within walking distance of every student's home.<br><br></p></p><h2>The Heart of a Goof</h2><p>&#34;In nine of Wodehouse&#39;s ripest stories from the 1920s, the characters are united by their worship of golf.

She has won both the Anthony and the Barry awards for her mystery fiction.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><p>As executive chef at the White House, I was responsible for feeding the First Family and&#x2014;whether they be friend or foe&#x2014;all the home&#x2019;s guests. I took my duties to heart, and was exceedingly proud of my team and the small part we played in shaping our country&#x2019;s history.</p><p>My role at the White House had evolved over the years, much to the Secret Service&#x2019;s dismay. Through no fault of my own (well, most of the time) I&#x2019;d been entangled in situations involving enemies of the president, international assassins, and those who attempted to conspire against the United States. Armed with stubborn tenacity and more than a bit of good luck, I&#x2019;d had a hand in seeing justice served, and even saved a few lives in the process.</p><p>It had been suggested, more than once, that President and Mrs. Hyden find less of a troublemaker to head up their kitchen. But the First Family liked me and what I brought to the table, both literally and figuratively.</p><p>Several months ago, Special Agent in Charge, Leonard Gavin&#x2014;Gav&#x2014;and I had gotten married in a surprise ceremony here in the White House. Surrounded by friends and family as we exchanged vows, my life changed forever. After the ceremony, during the sweet reception that my assistants, Bucky and Cyan, had arranged for us, I&#x2019;d endured countless good-natured barbs about how, now that I&#x2019;d &#x201c;settled down,&#x201d; perhaps my terrorist-fighting days were over.</p><p>And maybe they were.</p><p>Since our wedding day, life had been very, very quiet. And truly, I had no quarrel with that. If I never went into hand-to-hand combat, if I never faced another barrel of a gun, if I was never again left bound and gagged with no chance of escape, well, I wasn&#x2019;t about to complain.</p><p>I rested my chin in one hand, elbow perched on the White House kitchen&#x2019;s gleaming countertop. The fingers of my other hand beat out a non-rhythm of impatience against the shiny stainless steel.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not that I craved life-threatening adventure. Not at all. But right about now I would have appreciated a little diversion.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, we were in the middle of a government sequester. State dinners had been delayed, parties canceled, and visitors put off until our country&#x2019;s leadership got its act together.</p><p>Staring at the clock, waiting for Bucky to return from an errand, I reflected on the boredom that loomed ahead. I longed for a challenge. I hungered for the excitement that came from planning a state dinner&#x2014;the kind that kept guests talking for years, regaling envious friends with descriptions of mouthwatering appetizers and luxurious entrees. I ached to collaborate with the florist, the sommelier, and of course, Marcel, our executive pastry chef who could dream up a dessert that was as spectacular as it was sweet.</p><p>My skin practically crawled, itching for the president and First Lady to announce that a hundred guests were expected for dinner tomorrow night. I wouldn&#x2019;t have minded, even if they demanded we serve a seven-course meal. I would have gone insane with preparation, of course, but that was far more appealing than the doldrums we were facing now.</p><p>Most of all, I wanted Cyan back.</p><p>Until the country&#x2019;s situation improved, a number of &#x201c;nonessential&#x201d; members of the White House staff were on furlough&#x2014;among them, Cyan. I certainly didn&#x2019;t consider her nonessential. Quite the opposite. But when the government decided to slash salaries, they neglected to seek my counsel.</p><p>Bucky and I were doing our best to keep the kitchen operating efficiently, which&#x2014;to be fair&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t difficult, given the ripple effect the sequester was having on entertainment. I thanked my lucky stars Bucky hadn&#x2019;t been sent home, too. I&#x2019;d have gone stir-crazy on my own.</p><p>Because cost-cutting strategies involved eliminating most fancy dinners, he and I didn&#x2019;t have much to do beyond preparing the family&#x2019;s meals and feeding numerous&#x2014;often angry&#x2014;congressional leaders during marathon negotiation sessions held at the White House.</p><p>Marcel, the executive pastry chef whose French accent seemed to grow thicker with each passing day, had also been kept on. I knew why. Despite what the anti-Hyden pundits may assume, Marcel&#x2019;s job wasn&#x2019;t secure because the First Family chose to indulge their collective sweet tooth. Truth was, the Hydens weren&#x2019;t big fans of dessert. They preferred savory items.</p><p>What kept Marcel busy in his kitchen was the fact that the president recognized how effective a tray full of expertly crafted and lick-your-fingers-clean pastries could be at the bargaining table. While my concoctions of steak salad, lobster bisque, or pork tenderloin sandwiches satisfied appetites, Marcel&#x2019;s creations had far more potential to cheer up grumpy lawmakers.</p><p>In my heart, I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t complain. Granted, Cyan was out of the kitchen, and that wasn&#x2019;t optimal. But, on the bright side, Virgil was missing, too. A few months earlier the First Lady had delivered an ultimatum to our high-drama chef: Virgil would be required to seek help for his anger management issues and apologize to me and my staff or his career at the White House was over. The man had attempted to undermine my authority and sabotage my career once too often. That final, fateful time, Mrs. Hyden had witnessed his hostility and laid down the law.</p><p>Since that fateful day, we hadn&#x2019;t heard a peep from the dining diva. Our chief usher, Peter Everett Sargeant III, kept us informed enough to let us know that Virgil remained in town, but beyond that, no one knew what he was up to, nor whether he&#x2019;d taken steps to address his problems. He hadn&#x2019;t apologized. I had a feeling it was that, more than the mandate to get help, that was holding him back from returning to work.</p><p>With all that in mind, I&#x2019;d decided that my only option was to wait out the sequester with little to no complaint. Except for worrying about Cyan, who was living without a paycheck for the foreseeable future, we were under very little pressure. Food preparation at the White House had been the quietest and least stressful it had been for as long as I&#x2019;d worked here. Maybe I should try harder to enjoy the lull.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Ms. Paras.&#x201d;</p><p>I straightened to see Peter Sargeant and his assistant, Margaret, in my kitchen doorway. He wore his customary squirrel-alert expression. She carried a tablet and blinked at me from behind large tortoiseshell glasses. Neither smiled, but that was no surprise. Having them show up in my kitchen together, however, was. The last time they had, it had been to inform me of Cyan&#x2019;s furlough. I braced myself, hoping Bucky wasn&#x2019;t about to be cut, too.</p><p>Sargeant stepped forward, his ever-eager associate close behind. &#x201c;I hope we aren&#x2019;t interrupting your busy day.&#x201d; Giving a derisive look around the quiet, pristine kitchen, he added, &#x201c;Or your daydreaming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you need, Peter?&#x201d; I asked, ignoring the snarky comment. Over the years I&#x2019;d come to accept his personality. I appreciated the fact that I could depend on him for support when I needed it, but on a day-to-day basis, I found dealing with his persnickety attitude to be more than a bit tedious.</p><p>He turned to Margaret. &#x201c;You may do the honors.&#x201d;</p><p>She was tiny, even shorter than Sargeant, with small fingers and big eyes. Mid-forties, she sported a short, dark bob and wore clothes that were so perfectly suited, I wondered if she and Sargeant shared the same tailor.</p><p>&#x201c;We have news and important updates to share with you.&#x201d; She cleared her throat and read from her tablet. &#x201c;The first comes from an e-mail to Peter Everett Sargeant, from Parker Hyden.&#x201d; She glanced up at me at that, lifting her eyebrows in emphasis, as though I wouldn&#x2019;t have recognized the president&#x2019;s name on my own.</p><p>&#x201c;Share the pertinent information, Margaret,&#x201d; Sargeant said. &#x201c;No need for dramatics.&#x201d;</p><p>Margaret tightened her lips at the rebuke, pushed her glasses up her nose, and went on. &#x201c;We will host a Saardiscan dignitary for dinner, approximately two weeks from now.&#x201d; She slid her gaze toward Sargeant before continuing. &#x201c;The second update comes from the secretary of state, informing us that the chefs who were originally scheduled to visit your kitchen are on their way, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Saardiscans are coming?&#x201d; I repeated. &#x201c;What about the sequester?&#x201d;</p><p>Margaret said, &#x201c;Does it matter? We were told to notify all departments. That&#x2019;s really all you need to know.&#x201d;</p><p>Even Sargeant seemed taken aback by his assistant&#x2019;s snippiness. &#x201c;Yes, well, there is more to it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;As you know, the Saardiscan chefs&#x2019; visit was arranged for more than a year ago. We were loath to cancel.&#x201d;</p><p>I did know. This was a very big deal where our two countries&#x2019; diplomatic efforts were concerned. &#x201c;But you did cancel,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are you telling me they&#x2019;re coming tomorrow, after all?&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>I pinched the bridge of my nose, closing my eyes for a brief second to gather my thoughts. I&#x2019;d wished for this, I reminded myself. Mere moments ago.</p><p>Sargeant went on to explain, &#x201c;When the sequester was first announced, everything was canceled. The problem, at least as it relates to the White House, is that negotiation can be delicate with some countries. Saardisca is one of these.&#x201d;</p><p>I understood, even as my mind raced. Had we planned to entertain chefs from France or Canada, the administration might have been able to rearrange things with little more than a polite apology. Saardisca, however, was an uneasy ally. A frenemy. We hadn&#x2019;t had a political or ideological blowup between our countries in more than a decade, but that didn&#x2019;t mean we agreed on everything. Truth was, we didn&#x2019;t agree on much.</p><p>Yet, I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for this sudden change. I&#x2019;d had a plan in place for the Saardiscans&#x2019; visit, but once the sequester had been imposed, I&#x2019;d put those plans on hold. I needed to salvage my notes, pull lists together, and set up flowcharts.</p><p>Ideas banged against each other in my noisy brain; I barely registered that Sargeant was still talking.</p><p>&#x201c;Fulfilling our promise to Saardisca has been deemed of the utmost importance. The decision, therefore, has been made to honor our agreement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish I would have known this was a possibility,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>One side of his mouth curled up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the president regrets his oversight in neglecting to include you in the decision making.&#x201d;</p><p>I ignored the sarcasm. &#x201c;How long will they be here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two weeks?&#x201d; I repeated, surprise jolting my voice up several notches. &#x201c;I thought they were to visit for three or four days.&#x201d; So much for the original plans I&#x2019;d made. Those notes would barely get me started.</p><p>&#x201c;Things change,&#x201d; he said, deadpan. &#x201c;In what appears to be serendipitous timing, the delegates will be working with you for the duration of the Saardiscan presidential candidate&#x2019;s visit to the United States.

The incumbent had been in power for decades.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Kerry Freiberg,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you kept up with headlines, you would know that her campaign has been gaining steam.&#x201d;</p><p>I did keep up with headlines, but there had been no mention of her coming here. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the first female to run for that office, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one expects her to win, but the fact that she&#x2019;s the first woman to make it this far is garnering her a great deal of press.&#x201d; He sniffed. &#x201c;And because her platform is based on improving diplomatic relations with other countries, a stop in the United States is a requirement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A two-week stop.&#x201d; I rubbed my forehead. I needed to get organized, and quickly. &#x201c;Tell me what I need to know. Do you have the date that we&#x2019;ll be hosting her for dinner? Will there be more than one event? Do we have dietary dossiers for Ms. Freiberg and the members of her staff?&#x201d;</p><p>Margaret had begun taking notes, writing longhand with a stylus, as I outlined all the information I&#x2019;d need.</p><p>&#x201c;We will get back to you on these matters,&#x201d; Sargeant said when I took a breath. &#x201c;And whatever else you need to know.

Tucker makes the case that the Earth's 'carrying capacity' is limited to 3 billion humans, and that humanity's century long binge has incurred an unsustainable ecological debt that must be paid down promptly, or else cataclysm awaits. Given that our species has already surpassed 7.5 billion, and is fast approaching 9 billion or more, this is an audacious claim that everyone who cares about the fate of our planet and our species has a responsibility to evaluate for themselves. Tucker, in his exploration of the frontiers of scientific knowledge, urges all of us to question his estimate. He encourages us to marshal our own data and calculations, if we are so inclined, so that we can all engage in this existential debate as educated global citizens equipped to navigate what promises to be an uncertain future.</p><p> </p><p>Equal parts history, science, economics, demography, conservation thinking, ethics, and foreign affairs - all through a geographic lens - this provocative book fundamentally redefines how you will think about the fate of humanity, and the planet from which our species evolved. In part a continuation of E.O. Wilson's <em>Half-Earth</em> thesis, Tucker decrypts the complex story of how humanity has come to burden the finite geography of our planet in unsustainable ways. Tucker argues that we in fact have "A People Problem" which goes far beyond the very real perils of climate change and biodiversity loss. Tucker takes us on a journey through the history and geography of the ecological devastation wrought by humanity, and the persistent wastes that we have accumulated, as our population has grown relentlessly. Only by thinking geographically, Tucker argues, can we truly understand the threats to humanity and the Planet Earth that sustains us. In <em>A Planet of 3 Billion</em>, biogeography, human geography, and geostrategic thinking collide to illuminate the most pressing issues facing our world today.</p><p> </p><p>Beyond a detailed tour of this seemingly insurmountable challenge, Tucker offers solutions. Tucker makes a convincing case that renewal is possible, and that we can indeed find our way to a new sustainable population plateau of 3 billion without some ominous genocide, epidemic, or ecological collapse. Women - educated, empowered, integrated in to the workforce, and with access to family planning technologies - hold the key to our ecological salvation. All of us bear the responsibility for empowering women if we are to collectively chart a safe path to this new lower population plateau. And, together we must conjure up new ways to give Earth's panoply of unique ecoregions a voice, if we are to achieve an ecologically sustainable planet for our species over the long run.</p><p> </p><p>This book is for anyone who is interested in the world around them, concerned about the fate of the planet, and seeking insights that can help them become part of the solutions that would put us on a path to a resilient future.</p></p><p>CHRISTOPHER TUCKER has spent the last two decades at the intersection of technology, strategy, geography and national security as an innovator, investor, social entrepreneur, author, and strategic advisor to the US national security community. As Chairman of the American Geographical Society, he launched a multi-year strategic dialog known as Geography2050, focused on the vital trends that will reshape the geography of our planet over the coming decades. As the creator of MapStory.org, he pioneered the democratization of spatio-temporal data, and its use to understand our rich past, our complex present, and our uncertain future. He has served on a wide variety of public sector, corporate, and non-profit boards including the Defense Science Board Intelligence Task Force, the Director of National Intelligence&#39;s Strategic Studies Group, the Secretary of Interior&#39;s National Geospatial Advisory Committee, the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation, and the Open Geospatial Consortium. He holds a BA, MA, and PhD from Columbia University. His passion for geography and the fate of future generations animates this work.<p>Like Rachel Carson's <em>Silent Spring, </em> more than a half century ago, this book should serve as a wake-up call to a generation that is more in tune than ever with our planet's pulse. As Tucker proclaims, our planet has a people problem. And, as humanity and nature struggle to coexist sustainably, it is time for all of us to focus all our efforts on bending the human population curve downward. Tucker's formula begins with the empowerment of women, worldwide - but his cookbook for global citizens helps guide our collective actions to a resilient future. <em>A Planet of 3 Billion</em> is essential reading for anyone who cares about the fate of our planet and our species.<br> <br> <strong><em>Dr. Jane Goodall, DBE<br> Founder - the Jane Goodall Institute &amp; UN Messenger of Peace</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>It is easy to marvel at the sheer enormity and growth of our world, but it is irresponsible to do so without reckoning with its finiteness. In <em>A Planet of 3 Billion, </em> Dr. Christopher Tucker adeptly argues how we can (and we should) shrink the global population from nearing 9 billion to a more manageable 3 billion--and in so doing repay our debt to the planet, a burden it no longer can bear. Timely and instructive, Dr. Tucker's work explores the nuanced and often overlooked relationship between geography, women's empowerment, and leadership-- an intersection which could have tremendous impacts on our future.</p><p><em><strong>General Stanley A.

He answers that we build it in the way humans have always advanced before we lost our way. We had a plan and we adjusted to an environment. Now, we are determining the environment. We have become the designer species, but without a design. An invasive species with a brain, but no method to plan. Tucker outlines a thoughtful action plan for long term adaptation and success and does so with the complete set of tools and ideas and theories that will allow for massive human success going forward.

The North American fur trade, set in motion by the discovery of the New World in the fifteenth century, was this continent's biggest business for over three hundred years. Furs harvested by Ojibwa natives in the north woods ended up on the sleeves and hems of French princesses and Chinese emperors. Felt hats on the heads of every European businessman began as beaver pelts carried in birchbark canoes to trading posts dotting the wilderness. Iron tools, woolen blankets, and calico cloth manufactured in England found their way to wigwams along the remote rivers of North America. The fur trade influenced every aspect of life&#x2014;from how Europeans related to the Indians, how and where settlements were built, to how our nation formed. Drawing on primary sources, including the diaries of Ojibwa, American, and French traders of the period, this Society of School Librarians International Honor Book gives readers a glimpse of a little-known story from our past.</p><p><b>Cris Peterson </b>is the author of eight award-winning books for children, including&nbsp;<i>Century Farm: One Hundred Years on a Family Farm&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Horsepower:&nbsp;The Wonder of Draft Horses.</i>&nbsp;After earning a degree in history and education from the University of Minnesota, she moved to a dairy farm in Wisconsin, where she and her husband raised three children and continue to farm today. The idea for&nbsp;<i>Birchbark&nbsp;Brigade&nbsp;</i>formed from her love of the north woods&nbsp;and the obscure stories&nbsp;buried in its remote wilderness past.European fur trading in North America began early in the sixteenth century and ended when a nineteenth-century change in fashion made beaver hats pass�. At its height, the fur trade was big business as well as a means of exploring North America and, eventually, opening the path to European settlement. The first half of Peterson&#x2019;s well-researched account tightly packs a great deal of exploration (Columbus, Cabot, Cartier, Champlain, Joliet, Marquette, LaSalle, Duluth, Frontenac, Washington, Pontiac, Mackenzie) into six chapters. The second half employs firsthand accounts to discuss the voyageurs, settlers, and Native Americans in a considerably more involving manner. Throughout, black-and-white photos of sites and reproductions of period artwork, maps, and documents illustrate the text and sidebars. The extensive back matter includes a detailed time line, notes for the many quotes, a source bibliography, a suggested reading list, and descriptions of a dozen places to visit. This will fill a gap in many history collections.

His Diary is one of the principal sources for many aspects of the history of its period. In spite of its significance, all previous editions were inadequately edited and suffered from a number of omissions&#x2015;until Robert Latham and William Matthews went back to the 300-year-old original manuscript and deciphered each passage and phrase, no matter how obscure or indiscreet. <br><br>The Diary deals with some of the most dramatic events in English history. Pepys witnessed the London Fire, the Great Plague, the Restoration of Charles II, and the Dutch Wars. He was a patron of the arts, having himself composed many delightful songs and participated in the artistic life of London. His flair for gossip and detail reveals a portrait of the times that rivals the most swashbuckling and romantic historical novels. In none of the earlier versions was there a reliable, full text, with commentary and notation with any claim to completeness. This edition, first published in 1970, is the first in which the entire diary is printed with systematic comment. This is the only complete edition available; it is as close to Pepys&#x2019;s original as possible.</p><p><b>Robert Latham </b>was Pepys Librarian at Magdalene College, Cambridge. In addition to editing the eleven volumes of <i>The Diary of Samuel Pepys</i>, he was the editor of the acclaimed <i>Shorter Pepys</i> (1985) and <i>A Pepys Anthology</i> (1988), both published by University of California Press. <b>William Matthews</b> was Professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles.&#34;[Pepys] was not only Charles II&#39;s chief naval administrator, but a keen amateur of learning and an indefatigable enthusiast of politics, music, theater, women, life. He sets down his daily experience with a journalist&#39;s eye for detail, something of a novelist&#39;s sensitivity and, since he is writing for himself, a delightful frankness.&#34;--&#34;Publishers Weekly</p><h2>The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History, 1900-1916</h2><p><p>A radically new interpretation of the Progressive Era which argues that business leaders, and <i>not</i> the reformers, inspired the era&#x2019;s legislation regarding business.</p></p><p></p><h2>The New Real Book, Vol. 3</h2><p>The third collection of tunes in the world-class New Real Book format.

Two-dimensional works of art become three-dimensional thrillers. Philip Mould is an international art dealer who has lived the high stakes game of art sleuthing for twenty years. In Sleuth, we encounter the fascinating dealers, experts, auctioneers and restorers who risk fortunes and reputations to turn overlooked artworks into coveted treasures. Sleuth is laced with dramas: / Gainsborough&#39;s earliest picture emerges in a Los Angeles saleroom - the author has three days to find the missing facts and decide what to pay. / The most powerful man in the art establishment, with the influence to elevate a copy into a priceless original, is asked to look at a &#39;fake&#39; Rembrandt self portrait: if he says yes a GBP5,000 picture turns into GBP5 million masterpiece. / A Vermont professor unlocks the door of a defunct Catholic church to reveal a hidden cache of 300 portraits. / An auctioneer notices from the upper story of a bus that Damien Hirst&#39;s restaurant is being dismantled. He swoops in and sells the fixtures and fittings for GBP13 million. Sleuth is a series of stories which not only reveals the extraordinary culture of detection but the people behind it. Paintings and their discovery become a way into the minds, preoccupations and professions of a raft of influential figures beyond the commercial and museum facade - men and women who have shaped their lives in pursuit of truth and profit through art.</p><p>Philip Mould OBE is one of the UK&#39;s foremost authorities on British art, and is widely consulted by galleries, private collectors and the media. He is the author of the acclaimed Sleepers (released in paperback as The Trail of Lot 163), both published by Fourth Estate.

Petrinovic, consultant, Alabama Ballet School, Birmingham</p><p>Harriet Cavalli, internationally recognized as one of the most talented and experienced specialists in the art of music for dancers and dance teachers, presents here the definitive book on accompaniment, as well as her personal--often humorous--look behind the scenes at the world of dance. The text is enhanced by diagrams and 83 complete musical examples, providing a wealth of repertoire choices.</p><p>One of the most comprehensive books to acknowledge the intimate link between music and ballet technique, <i>Dance and Music</i> emphasizes the necessity of effective communication between dance teachers and their accompanists. Cavalli lays the groundwork with descriptions of most musical forms used in the dance classroom and stresses the need for teachers to make music a living part of their classes.</p><p>For the inexperienced accompanist, she describes the pianistic demands of the profession, as well as the qualities of dance steps and movements that will facilitate the identification of suitable music. She also discusses the kinds of dance classes an accompanist may work in and offers a lengthy section on the functions of a pianist in a dance company.</p><p>With forty years in the field, and firsthand knowledge of what dancing feels like and how to re-create that feeling, Cavalli invites musicians to move gracefully into the special, sometimes intimidating world of dance accompaniment.</p><p><b>Harriet Cavalli</b> is the company pianist for Martin Schl�pfer&#x2019;s BallettMainz at the Mainz State Theater in Germany. She has worked for most of the major dance institutions in New York, such as the Joffrey and Harkness Ballets and American Ballet Theater, and with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, First Chamber Dance Company in Seattle, Zurich Opera Ballet, Basel Ballet, and Bern Ballet. In addition, she has studied ballet with Perry Brunson, Maria Swoboda, Flemming Halby, Donna Silva, and Martin Schl�pfer.</p></p><p>Harriet Cavalli is the company pianist for Martin Schlapfer&#39;s BallettMainz at the Mainz State Theater in Germany.Currently the company pianist for the BallettMainz at the Mainz State Theater, Cavalli drew on 40-plus years' experience to write this one-of-a-kind manual. In straightforward, no-nonsense prose, she spells out ways for the teacher and the accompanist to make the rehearsal a success. She says, for example, that dance teachers must learn to count correctly and treat the accompanist with respect. Not surprisingly, Cavalli's real forte is explaining accompaniment. Beginning accompanists will especially benefit from her advice on selecting the proper music and defining their role in a dance company. By far the most thorough treatise on the subject in print, this work also discusses classroom etiquette, dance class structure, how teachers demonstrate, and steps and movements. A glossary of dance steps, movements, and positions and over 150 pages of musical examples are included.

They came by the thousands, citizens of a nation on the rise, defying the lessons drilled into them by state propaganda and the caution taught them by a century of bitter experience. On a cold January morning, in sleek sedans and battered taxicabs, on bicycle and on foot, they made their way past security checkpoints, refusing to turn back even when police snapped photos and recorded their names for the state's secret files. Slowly, they converged on a vast cemetery on the western outskirts of Beijing. There, in a small memorial hall, on a dais surrounded by evergreen leaves, lay the man whose death they had come to mourn, a man the party had told them to forget.</p><p>They last saw him more than fifteen years ago, with a bullhorn in his hands and tears in his eyes, standing in Tiananmen Square amid the students who were demanding democratic reform in the spring of 1989. Zhao Ziyang was general secretary of the Communist Party then, only the third man to hold the party's top post after Mao's death, so it was a surprise when he suddenly appeared before dawn that May morning and waded into the crowd of young protesters. He was a grandfatherly figure in a gray tunic suit, already seventy years old with white hair and large round glasses. As the television cameras rolled, he told the students he sympathized with their cause and accepted their criticism, and he urged them to go home. But his voice trembled with emotion, and there was a hint of the tragedy to come in his words. "We have come too late, too late," he said, choking up, his face drawn with exhaustion. And then he was gone. It was not until much later, after the tanks had entered the capital and the soldiers opened fi re, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands, that the world learned Zhao had been ousted by party elders just before coming to the square. He had sided with the students, refusing to order the military to crush the demonstrations.</p><p>The party put Zhao under house arrest and set about erasing him from public memory. He was airbrushed from photographs, deleted from textbooks, and any mention of his name in the media was forbidden. It was as if the Communist leader who came closer than anyone else to bringing democratic change to the country simply ceased to exist. As he languished in custody, the state spun its own version of history: The bloodshed in Tiananmen was necessary to restore order. China was too big, too poor, too uneducated for democracy, which would lead to chaos and civil war. Only one-party rule could ensure stability in the world's most populous nation, and only stability could guarantee the economic growth needed to make the country strong. The propagandists promoted these arguments tirelessly, and the censors buried competing views. With repetition and the passage of time -- and the help of an economy that soared -- many Chinese came to accept this view of their nation, and the world welcomed China back into the ranks of respectable powers. But all the while, the party continued to confine Zhao to his traditional courtyard home in Beijing. He was a symbol of another vision for China, one that still resonated with the public despite the party's efforts to wipe it out. The men who held power knew this, and they were afraid.</p><p>When Zhao died on January 17, 2005, after suffering a series of strokes at the age of eighty-five, the party's leaders convened a series of emergency meetings to prepare a response that would prevent his death from triggering a new debate about the Tiananmen massacre or fresh demonstrations for democratic reform. Though Zhao had served as premier for seven years and party chief for three, pioneering the market reforms in the 1980s that would transform the Chinese economy, his successors ordered state television and radio not to announce his death. The very few granted permission to report the story were told to use a one-sentence dispatch that referred to him only as "comrade" and to make no mention of his past leadership posts. The <i>Beijing Evening News</i> buried the item on page sixteen, under a brief about the Golden Globe awards ceremony in the United States.</p><p>But the party's control of information had weakened in the years since Tiananmen. Word of Comrade Zhao's death spread quickly across the nation he once led via home satellite dishes and cell phones, e-mail and instant messaging. Within hours, citizens posted thousands of notes of sorrow and remembrance on Internet bulletin boards, then watched as the censors tried to delete them. "Can't we grieve when someone has died?" wrote one user in frustration on the Web site of the <i>People's Daily,</i> the party's flagship newspaper. In the following days, as it became clear the leadership had decided to deny Zhao the honor of a state funeral, people began sending flowers to his home; soon there were enough to fill several rooms. Then mourners started showing up at the house. Hundreds came to pay their respects, and when police tried to stop them, they waited outside in the cold. Some refused to leave and were dragged away.</p><p>Zhao's death revealed a scar on the nation's conscience. For years, people had tried to put Tiananmen behind them. Friends avoided the subject, and parents told their children not to ask about it. Many of those who had been part of the democracy movement threw themselves into making money, claiming they no longer cared about their country's political fate. The pain of remembering, the guilt of giving up and moving on -- for many, it was too much to bear, and looking away seemed the only way to live. But when Zhao died, people allowed themselves a moment to reflect again on those young men and women killed in 1989, and to ask whether their sacrifice had meant anything. They examined what had become of their country in the years since the massacre, and let themselves wonder what might have been had the students moderated their demands and prevailed. They considered the failings of the party's marriage of authoritarian politics with capitalist economics. Yes, China had grown more prosperous and gained international prestige. But the boom had also left many behind, and the nation's troubles were obvious to anyone willing to see: the stifling limits on political and religious freedoms, the abuse of power by privileged officials, the sweatshop conditions in the factories, the persistent poverty in the countryside, the degradation of the environment, the moral drift of a cynical society.</p><p>Zhao had been a party activist since he was a teenager, but when Politburo hard-liners pressured him to crush the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, he refused. And when the nation's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, ordered troops into the capital, he tendered his resignation. Years later, when Deng offered to reinstate him if only he would admit he was wrong and endorse the crackdown, Zhao again said no. Zhao made it clear that there was a line he would not cross. How many others could say the same? How many had signed statements repeating the party's lies about Tiananmen to save themselves in the crackdown that followed? How many continued to curry favor with the party to further their careers or gain an edge in business? How many could really say their hands were clean?</p><p>Wang junxiu had just arrived in his Beijing office, and was bypassing the government's Internet controls and checking the news on overseas Web sites. As he clicked, he spotted the item: Zhao Ziyang, former Chinese Communist Party chief, dead at eighty-five. So it really happened, he thought. The old man finally passed away.</p><p>A stocky fellow in his mid-thirties with a rough, pudgy face, Wang was the cofounder and chief executive officer of China's most popular blog-hosting Web site, Bokee.com. For weeks government censors had been warning him to prevent rumors about Zhao's failing health from being posted on the site. Zhao could die at any moment, they said, and if he did, they didn't want Wang's five million users reading about it or discussing it. As usual, Wang assured them he would comply. But he also knew there was really no need for the warning. His company had long ago programmed its software to block people from mentioning Zhao's name in their blogs.</p><p>Wang felt a dull sadness. Until the censors started calling, he had not thought about Zhao in years. For most of the past decade and a half, Wang had been immersing himself in books about memory chips and programming languages, and building a comfortable life for himself and his wife, complete with a two-bedroom apartment in the suburbs. But Zhao's death brought back memories from another life, one in which he dared to fight for principles like freedom of speech. It stirred up feelings that had been gnawing at his conscience and doubts about the choices he had made. It made him wonder what had become of the young idealist he once was.</p><p>It felt as if a lifetime had passed since he participated in the protests in Tiananmen Square, but now he remembered the exhilaration of marching through the city as part of a crowd of hundreds of thousands; the cry of students chanting slogans for freedom and democracy; the conviction that he could make a difference and help steer his nation toward a better future. He was a junior at the China University of Politics and Law then, a shy kid from the countryside who gained self-confidence in the student movement. As the demonstrations grew and spread across the country that spring, Wang set up a loudspeaker station on his campus so classmates could broadcast news and speeches. He often spent his days in the square and his nights at the loudspeaker station, sleeping only a few hours at a time and living off the adrenalin rush of idealism. He was at the station on the night the army opened fire, reading out the reports of violence as they came in, but he kept thinking that there must be a mistake, that the military couldn't have done this, that people ...</p></p><h2>Retribution Falls</h2><p>Frey is the captain of the Ketty Jay.

He smiled sourly.<br><br>"Just imagine," he said. "Imagine what this feels like going through your head."<br><br>Grayther Crake didn't want to imagine anything of the sort. He was trying not to throw up, having already disgraced himself once that morning. He glanced at the man next to him, hoping for some sign that he had a plan, some way to get them out of this. But Darian Frey's face was hard and showed nothing.<br><br>Both of them had their wrists tied together, backs against the damp and peeling wall. Three armed thugs ensured they stayed there.<br><br>The smuggler's name was Lawsen Macarde. He was squat and grizzled, hair and skin greasy with a sheen of sweat and grime, features squashed across a face that was broad and deeply lined. Crake watched him slide the bullet into the empty drum of his revolver. He snapped it shut, spun it, then turned toward his audience.<br><br>"Do you think it hurts?" he mused. "Even for a moment? Or is it all over-bang!-in a flash?"<br><br>"If you're that curious, try it out on yourself," Frey suggested.<br><br>Macarde hit him in the gut, putting all of his considerable weight behind the punch. Frey doubled over with a grunt and almost went to his knees. He straightened with some effort until he was standing again.<br><br>"Good point," he wheezed. "Well made."<br><br>Macarde pressed the muzzle of the revolver against Crake's forehead and stared at Frey.<br><br>"Count of three. You want to see your man's brains all over the wall?"<br><br>Frey didn't reply. Crake's face was gray beneath his close-cropped blond beard. He stank of alcohol and sweat. His eyes flicked to the captain nervously.<br><br>"One."<br><br>Frey showed no signs of reacting.<br><br>"I'm just a passenger!" Crake said. "I'm not even part of his crew!" His accent betrayed an aristocratic upbringing that wasn't evident from his appearance. His hair was scruffy, his boots vomit-spattered, his greatcoat half unbuttoned and hanging open. He was near soiling himself with fear.<br><br>"You have the ignition code for the Ketty Jay?" Macarde asked him. "You know how to fire her up and get her flying?"<br><br>Crake swallowed and shook his head.<br><br>"Then shut up. Two."<br><br>"Nobody flies the Ketty Jay but me, Macarde. I told you that," Frey said. His eyes flickered restlessly around the storeroom. Cloud- muffled sunlight drifted in through horizontal slits high up on one stone wall, illuminating rough-hewn hemp sacks, coils of rope, wicked- looking hooks that hung on chains from the ceiling. Chill shadows cut deep into the seamed faces of Macarde and his men, and the air smelled of damp and decay.<br><br>"Three," said Macarde, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Crake flinched and whimpered as the hammer fell on an empty chamber. After a moment, it sank in: he was still alive. He let out a shuddering breath as Macarde took the gun away, then cast a hateful glare at Frey.<br><br>Frey's expression was blank. He was a different person from the man Crake had known the night before. That man had laughed as loud as Malvery and made fun of Pinn with the rest of them. He told stories that had them in stitches and drank until he passed out. That man, Crake had known for almost three months. That man, Crake might have called a friend.<br><br>Macarde studied the pistol theatrically. "Five chambers. One down. Think you'll be lucky again?" He put the muzzle back to Crake's forehead.<br><br>"Oh, please, no," Crake begged. "Please, please, no. Frey, tell him. Stop playing around and just tell him."<br><br>"One," said Macarde.<br><br>Crake stared at the now-stranger to his right, his eyes pleading. No doubt about it, it was the same man. There were the same wolfishly handsome features, the same unkempt black hair, the same lean frame beneath his long coat. But the spark in his eyes had gone. There was no sign of the ready, wicked smile that usually lurked at the corner of his mouth.<br><br>He wasn't going to give in.<br><br>"Two."<br><br>"Please," he whispered. But Frey just looked away.<br><br>"Three."<br><br>Macarde paused on the trigger, waiting for a last-moment intervention. It didn't come.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Crake's heart leaped hard enough to hurt. He let out a gasp. His mouth was sticky, his whole body was trembling, and he desperately wanted to be sick again.<br><br>You bastard, he thought. You rot-hearted bastard.<br><br>"Didn't think you had it in you, Frey," Macarde said, with a hint of admiration in his voice. He thrust the revolver back into a holster somewhere amid the motley of battered jackets that he wore. "You'd let him die rather than give up the Ketty Jay? That's cold."<br><br>Frey shrugged. "He's just a passenger." Crake swore at him under his breath.<br><br>Macarde paced around the storeroom while a rat-faced thug covered the prisoners with the point of a cutlass. The other two thugs stood in the shadows: an enormous shaven-headed bruiser and a droop-eyed man wearing a tatty knitted cap. One guarded the only exit, the other lounged against a barrel, idly examining a lever-action shotgun. There were a dozen more like them downstairs.<br><br>Crake clawed at his mind for some way to escape. In spite of the shock and the pounding in his head, he forced himself to be rational. He'd always prided himself on his discipline and self-control, which only made the humiliation of the last few moments harder to bear. He'd pictured himself displaying a little more dignity in the face of his own extinction.<br><br>Their pistols had been taken after they were found at the inn, snoring drunk at the table. Macarde had taken Frey's beautiful cutlass-my cutlass, Crake thought bitterly-for his own. Now it hung tantalizingly from his belt. Crake noticed Frey watching it closely.<br><br>What of Malvery and Pinn? They'd evidently wandered off elsewhere in the night to continue their carousing, leaving their companions to sleep. It was simply bad luck that Macarde had found him and Frey, tonight of all nights. A few more hours and they'd have been out of port and away. Instead, they'd been dragged upstairs-pausing only for Crake to be sick on his own feet-and bundled into this dank storeroom, where an anonymous and squalid death awaited them if Frey didn't give up the ignition codes for his aircraft.<br><br>I could be dead, Crake thought. That son of a bitch didn't do a thing to stop it.<br><br>"Listen," said Macarde to Frey. "Let's be businessmen about this. We go back, you and I. Worked together several times, haven't we? And even though I came to expect a certain sloppiness from you over the years-late delivery, cargo that wasn't quite what you promised, that sort of thing-you never flat-out screwed me. Not 'til now."<br><br>"What do you want me to say, Macarde? It wasn't meant to end up this way."<br><br>"I don't want to kill you, Frey," said Macarde in a tone that suggested the opposite. "I don't even want to kill that milksop little pansy over there. I just want what's mine. You owe me an aircraft. I'll take the Ketty Jay."<br><br>"The Ketty Jay's worth five of yours."<br><br>"Well, consider the difference as the price of me not cutting off your balls and stuffing them in your ears."<br><br>"That's fair," conceded Frey.<br><br>"That aerium you sold me was bad stuff. Admit it."<br><br>"What did you expect for that price?"<br><br>"You told me it came straight from the refinery. What you sold me was so degraded it wouldn't have lifted a biscuit, let alone twenty tons of aircraft."<br><br>"Sales patter. You know how it is."<br><br>"It must have been through the engines of every freebooter from here to the coast!" Macarde growled. "I'd have got better quality stuff siphoning it off the wrecks in a junkyard!"<br><br>Crake gave Frey a fleeting look of guilt. "Actually," grinned Frey, "it'd have been about the same."<br><br>Macarde's punch came blindingly fast, snapping Frey's head back so it cracked against the wall. Frey groaned and put his hands to his face. His fingertips came away bloody from a split lip.<br><br>"Little less attitude will make this all go a lot smoother," Macarde advised.<br><br>"Right," said Frey. "Now you listen. If there's some way I can make this up to you, some job I can do, something I can steal, whatever you want . . . well, that's one thing. But you will never get my craft, you hear? You can stuff whatever you like in my ears. The Ketty Jay is mine."<br><br>"I don't think you're in much of a position to negotiate," Macarde said.<br><br>"Really? 'Cause the way I see it, the Ketty Jay is useless without the ignition code, and the only one who knows it is me. That puts me in a pretty strong position as long as I don't tell you."<br><br>Macarde made a terse gesture toward Droop-Eye. "Cut off his thumbs."<br><br>Droop-Eye left his shotgun atop the barrel he'd been leaning on and drew a dagger.<br><br>"Whoa, wait!" said Frey quickly. "I'm talking compensation. I'm talking giving you more than the value of your craft. You cut off my thumbs and I can't fly. Believe me, you do that and I take the code to my grave."<br><br>"I had five men on that craft," said Macarde, as Droop-Eye came over. "They were pulling up out of a canyon. I saw it. The pilot tried to get the lift and suddenly it just wasn't there. Bad aerium, see? Couldn't clear the lip of the canyon. Tore the belly off, and the rest of it went up in flames. Five men dead. You going to compensate me for them too?"<br><br>"Listen, there's got to be something you want." He motioned suddenly at Crake. "Here, I know! He's got a gold tooth. Solid gold. Show them, Crake."<br><br>Crake stared at the captain in disbelief.<br><br>"I don't want a gold tooth, Frey," said Macarde patiently. "Give me your thumbs."<br><br>"It's a start!" Frey cried. He glared hard and meaningfully at Crake. "Crake, why don't you show them your gold tooth?"<br><br>"Here, let us have a look," Rat said, leaning closer to Crake. "Show us a smile, you little nancy."<br><br>Crake took a deep, steadying breath and gave Rat his most dazzling grin. It was a picture pose he'd perfected in response to a mortifying ferrotype taken by the family photographer. After that, he vowed he'd never be embarrassed by a picture again.<br><br>"Hey! That's not half bad," Rat commented, peering at his reflection in the shiny tooth. And Crake grinned, harder than he'd ever grinned in his life.<br><br>Droop-Eye pulled Frey away from the wall, over to a set of cobwebbed shelves. He swept away a few empty jars with his arm and then forced Frey's bound hands down onto the shelf. Frey had balled his fists and was refusing to extend his thumbs. Droop-Eye hammered him in the kidney, but he still held fast.<br><br>"What I'm saying, Macarde, is that we can both come out ahead," Frey argued through gritted teeth. "We'll work off the debt, me and my crew."<br><br>"You'll be halfway to New Vardia the second I take my eyes off you," Macarde replied.<br><br>"What about collateral? What if I leave you one of the fighters? Pinn has a Skylance; that thing's faster than greased owl shit. You ought to see it go!"<br><br>Droop-Eye drove a knee into his thigh, making him grunt, but Frey still wouldn't extend his thumbs. The thug by the door smirked at his companion's attempts to make Frey cooperate.<br><br>"Here, listen!" Rat shouted. Everyone stopped and turned to look at him, surprised by the volume of his voice. A strange expression crossed his face, as if he was puzzled to find himself the center of attention. Then it disappeared beneath a dawning revelation.<br><br>"Why don't we let them go?" he suggested.<br><br>Macarde gave him a reptilian glare. "What?" he said slowly.<br><br>"No, wait, hear me out," said Rat, with the attitude of one caught up in an idea so brilliant that it would require careful explanation to his benighted audience. "I mean, killing 'em won't do no good to us. They don't look like they've got a shillie to their name anyways. If we let 'em go, they could, you know, spread the good word and stuff: 'That Lawsen Macarde is a reasonable man. The kind of man you can do business with.' "<br><br>Macarde had been steadily reddening as Rat's speech went on, and now his unshaven jowls were trembling with fury. Droop-Eye and Bruiser exchanged wary glances. Neither of them knew what had possessed their companion to pipe up with his opinion, but they both knew the inevitable outcome. Macarde's hand twitched toward the hilt of Frey's cutlass.<br><br>"You should listen to the man," said Crake. "He talks a lot of sense."<br><br>Macarde's murderous gaze switched to Crake. Absurdly, Crake was still smiling. He flashed his toothy grin at Macarde now, looking for all the world like some oily salesman instead of a man facing his imminent demise.<br><br>But then Macarde noticed something. The anger drained from his face and he craned in to look a little closer.<br><br>"That's a nice tooth," he murmured.<br><br>Yes, keep looking, you ugly bag of piss, Crake thought to himself. You just keep looking.<br><br>Macarde's eyes glazed over, mesmerized. Crake directed every ounce of his willpower at the smuggler. Your man's idea isn't so bad, when you think about it. A show of generosity now will only increase your standing in the eyes of your customers. They'll come flocking with their deals, offering the best cuts for the privilege of working with you. You'll own this town!<br><br>But Macarde was smarter than Rat. The tooth worked only on the weak- minded. He was resisting; Crake could see it on his face. Even bewitched as he was by the tooth, Macarde sensed that something was amiss.<br><br>A chill spread through Crake's body, something icier and more insidious than simple fear. The tooth was draining him. Hungover and weak as he was, he couldn't keep up the fight for long, and he'd already used his best efforts on Rat.<br><br>Give it up, he silently begged Macarde. Just give it up.<br><br>Then the smuggler blinked, and his gaze cleared. He stared at Crake, shocked. Crake's grin faded slowly.<br><br>"He's a daemonist!" Macarde cried, then pulled the pistol from his holster, put it to Crake's head, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Macarde was as surprised as Crake was. He'd forgotten that he'd loaded his pistol with only a single bullet. There was an instant's pause, then everything happened at once.<br><br>Frey's cutlass flew out of Macarde's belt, leaping ten feet across the room, past Droop-Eye and into the captain's waiting hands. Droop- Eye's final moments were spent staring in incomprehension as Frey drove the cutlass double-handed into his belly.<br><br>Macarde's bewilderment at having his cutlass stolen by invisible hands gave Crake the time he needed to gather himself. He drove a knee hard into the fat man's groin. Macarde's eyes bulged and he staggered back a step, making a faint squealing noise like a distressed piglet.<br><br>His hands still bound, Crake wrestled the revolver from Macarde's beefy fingers just as Rat shook off the effects of the tooth and drew his own cutlass back for a thrust. Crake swung the gun about and squeezed the trigger. This time, the hammer found the bullet. It discharged point-blank in Rat's face, blowing a geyser of red mist from the back of his skull with a deafening bang. He tottered a few steps on his heels and collapsed onto a heap of rope.<br><br>Macarde was stumbling toward the door, unwittingly blocking Bruiser's line of fire. As the last thug fought to get an angle, Frey dropped his cutlass, darted across the room, and scooped up the lever-action shotgun that Droop-Eye had left on the barrel. Bruiser shoved his boss behind him to get a clear shot at Crake and succeeded only in providing one for Frey, who unloaded the shotgun into his chest wi...</p><h2>Country Matters: The Pleasures and Tribulations of Moving from a Big City to an Old Country Farmhouse</h2><p><p>With his inimitable sense of humor and storytelling talent, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Michael Korda brings us this charming, hilarious, self-deprecating memoir of a city couple's new life in the country.</p><p>At once entertaining, canny, and moving, <em>Country Matters</em> does for Dutchess County, New York, what <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em> did for Tuscany. This witty memoir, replete with Korda's own line drawings, reads like a novel, as it chronicles the author's transformation from city slicker to full-time country gentleman, complete with tractors, horses, and a leaking roof.</p><p>When he decides to take up residence in an eighteenth-century farmhouse in Dutchess County, ninety miles north of New York City, Korda discovers what country life is really like:</p><ul><li>Owning pigs, more than owning horses, even more than owning the actual house, firmly anchored the Kordas as residents in the eyes of their Pleasant Valley neighbors. </li><li>You may own your land, but without concertina barbed wire, or the 82nd Airborne on patrol, it's impossible to keep people off it! </li><li>It's possible to line up major household repairs over a tuna melt sandwich. </li><li>And everyone in the area is fully aware that Michael "don't know shit about septics."</li></ul><p>The locals are not particularly quick to accept these outsiders, and the couple's earliest interactions with their new neighbors provide constant entertainment, particularly when the Kordas discover that hunting season is a year-round event -- right on their own land! From their closest neighbors, mostly dairy farmers, to their unforgettable caretaker Harold Roe -- whose motto regarding the local flora is "Whack it all back! " -- the residents of Pleasant Valley eventually come to realize that the Kordas are more than mere weekenders.</p><p>Sure to have readers in stitches, this is a book that has universal appeal for all who have ever dreamed of owning that perfect little place to escape to up in the country, or, more boldly, have done it.</p></p><p>Despite the fact that Michael Korda was city born and bred (and, as editor in chief of Simon &amp; Schuster and a bestselling author, part of Manhattan's elite), when he decided it was time to put down roots, he wanted land, trees, and a place in a community with history. The house he bought with his wife, Margaret, in Pleasant Valley, two hours north of New York City, was built when George Washington was president. It came with two barns, 20 acres, a backhoe, a bush hog, a York rake, a dozer blade, a bluff, and a slightly deaf old man named Harold Roe. Since Korda couldn't handle a hammer (plumbing and heating problems in his past merely involved calling the building super and keeping a 20-dollar bill handy), Harold became a permanent fixture, wielding large equipment, destroying the flowers, and showing the couple everything they needed to know about the real country. <p> Pleasant Valley, it turned out, was on the "wrong" side of the Taconic Parkway. It was "red and black plaid hats with earflaps and insulated bib-front overalls country," as opposed to Ralph Lauren estates country. Despite the blue-collar atmosphere (or rather because of it), the Kordas have been there for two decades. Becoming locals hasn't been easy, however. Korda relishes the moments that mark him as an insider--hanging out at the local diner, buying a Harley-Davidson, and most importantly, buying pigs. Pig watching in a place like Pleasant Valley is a truly bonding experience, which Korda describes with his characteristic dry wit: </p><blockquote> Pig watching is not something anybody does in a hurry, as we came to learn. You have to shift your trousers down a bit, loosen up your belt a notch or so, give your belly a little breathing room, light a cigarette if you're a smoker, and look at the pigs for a good long time. Then you sigh, nod your head, and say, "Them's nice pigs, them pigs." Then you look at them some more. </blockquote> You get the idea. A natural raconteur, Korda makes the quirks of living in an old house and the quest for local status in an insular community highly entertaining, and he proves once again that, while he may not be handy with tools, he certainly knows his way around the written word. <i>--Lesley Reed</i><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S.

Each takes as her subject one of the four March sisters, reflecting on their stories and what they have to teach us about life. Kate Bolick finds parallels in oldest sister Meg's brush with glamour at the Moffats' ball and her own complicated relationship with clothes. Jenny Zhang confesses to liking Jo least among the sisters when she first read the novel as a girl, uncomfortable in finding so much of herself in a character she feared was too unfeminine. Carmen Maria Machado writes about the real-life tragedy of Lizzie Alcott, the inspiration for third sister Beth, and the horror story that can result from not being the author of your own life's narrative. And Jane Smiley rehabilitates the reputation of youngest sister Amy, whom she sees as a modern feminist role model for those of us who are, well, not like the fiery Jo. These four voices come together to form a deep, funny, far-ranging meditation on the power of great literature to shape our lives.</p><p><b>KATE BOLICK</b> is the author of <i>Spinster: Making a Life of One's Own</i> and is a contributing editor to <i>The Atlantic</i>.<br><br><b>JENNY ZHANG</b> is a writer and poet based in New York City and the author of the story collection<i> Sour Heart</i>. <br><br><b>CARMEN MARIA MACHADO</b> is the author of the story collection <i>Her Body and Other Parties </i>and a contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Granta</i>, <i>Tin House</i>, <i>Guernica</i>, and other publications.<br><br><b>JANE SMILEY</b> is the author of many novels, works of nonfiction, and books for young adults, including <i>A Thousand Acres</i> and <i>The Last Hundred Years</i> trilogy, and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<br><br><b>Kate Bolick </b>lives in Brooklyn.<br><br><b>Jenny Zhang</b> lives in New York City. <br><br><b>Carmen Maria Machado </b>lives in Philadelphia.<br><br><b>Jane Smiley</b> lives in northern California."In addition to sharing literary insights and personal histories, the authors also discuss the extent to which the Marches resembled and diverged from their real-life models: Alcott&#x2019;s own sisters.

In this new and imaginative followup, Aimee Nezhukumatathil examines the full circle journey of desire, loss, and ultimately, an exuberant lovetraveling around a world brimming with wild and delicious offerings such as iced waterfalls, jackfruit, and pistol shrimp. From the tropical landscapes of the Caribbean, India, and the Philippines to the deep winters of western New York and mild autumns of Ohio, the natural world Nezhukumatathil describes is dark but also lovelyso full of enchantment and magic. Here, worms glow in the dark, lizards speak, the most delicious soup in the world turns out to be deadly, and a woman eats soil as if it were candy. Her trademark charm, verve and wit remain elemental and a delight to behold, even in the face of a crumbling relationship. These poems confront delicate subjects of love and loss with an exacting exuberance and elegance not hardly seen in a writer so young.</p><p><b>Aimee Nezhukumatathil</b> 's previous book of poetry, <i>Miracle Fruit (2003), won the the Tupelo Press Prize, the ForeWord Magazine Book of the Year Award in poetry, and the Global Filipino Award.

She is associate professor of English at State University of New York-Fredonia, where she is a recipient of the campus-wide Hagan Young Scholar Award and the SUNY Chancellor's Medal for Scholarly and Creative Activities.</i>Aimee Nezhukumatathil's poems are as ripe, funny and fresh as a precious friendship. They're the fullness of days, deliciously woven of heart and verve, rich with sources and elements animals, insects, sugar, cardamom, legends, countries, relatives, soaps, fruits taste and touch. I love the nubby layerings of lines, luscious textures and constructions. Aimee writes with a deep resonance of spirit and sight. She's scared of nothing. She knows that many worlds may live in one house. Poems like these revive our souls.

The dominant theme is that the current socioeconomic system governing the world at this time has severe <em>structural flaws</em>, born out of primitive economic and sociological assumptions originating in our early history, where the inherent severity of these flaws went largely unnoticed. </p><p> However, in the early 21st century, these problems have risen prominently, taking the consequential form of increasing social destabilization and ongoing environmental collapse. Yet, this text is not simply about explaining such problems and their root causality - It is also about posing <em>concrete solutions</em>, coupled with a new perspective on social/environmental sustainability and efficiency which, in concert with the tremendous possibility of modern technology and a phenomenon known as <em>ephemeralization</em>, reveals humanity's current capacity to create an abundant, <em>post-scarcity</em> reality. </p><p> While largely misunderstood as being "utopian" or fantasy, this text walks through, step by step, the<em> train of thought</em> and technical industrial reordering needed to update our global society (and its values) to enable these profound new possibilities. While this text can be read strictly from a passive perspective, it was created also to be used as an awareness or <em>activist </em>tool. The Zeitgeist Movement, which has hundreds of chapters across dozens of countries and is perhaps the largest activist organization of its kind, hopes those interested in this direction will join the movement in global solidarity and assist in the culmination of this new social model, for the benefit of the whole of humanity. </p><p> Note: This text is produced for sale in paperback and proprietary ebook form only at the <em>exact cost</em> of publishing and nothing more.

In this exciting new volume, these two formidable foes team up to try to rid the West of Rabbi Harvey once and for all. The key to their evil scheme: Bad Bubbe&#x2019;s darling son, Rabbi &#x201c;Wisdom Kid&#x201d; Rubin, newly arrived from back East. He&#x2019;s young. He&#x2019;s clever. He&#x2019;s eager to take Harvey&#x2019;s place. But is he fast enough on the draw&#x2015;the wisdom draw, that is&#x2015;to take the town from Rabbi Harvey?</p><p>The hilarious, action-packed plot draws on classic Jewish folktales, Talmudic teachings and the timeless wisdom of the wise men of Chelm. As always, Rabbi Harvey protects his town and delivers justice, wielding only the weapons of wisdom, wit and a bit of trickery. He also gets a bit of help from Abigail, the town&#x2019;s quick-thinking school teacher&#x2015;a woman, it appears, who just may have captured his heart.</p></p><p><p><b>Steve Sheinkin</b> is the writer and illustrator of <i>The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey: A Graphic Novel of Jewish Wisdom and Wit in the Wild West,</i> for which he won <i>Moment Magazine's</i> Emerging Writer Award in children's literature; <i>Rabbi Harvey Rides Again: A Graphic Novel of Jewish Folktales Let Loose in the Wild West</i> and <i>Rabbi Harvey vs. the Wisdom Kid: A Graphic Novel of Dueling Jewish Folktales in the Wild West</i>.</p><p><br><strong>Steve Sheinkin is available to speak on the following topics: </strong></p><ul><li>Drawing Comics</li><li>Graphic Novels</li><li>Jewish Folktales</li><li>Jewish Wisdom</li></ul>Graphic-novel heroes can be anything from X-Men to Buddhist priests. So why not a rabbi? And why not a rabbi who lives in nineteenth-century Elk Spring, Colorado, where the women are purty and everyone seems to be Jewish? Sheinkin takes this conceit and gallops with it as Rabbi Harvey (he loves learning, justice, and trout) jousts against a formidable rival, Rabbi Ruben. Ruben comes armed with his own wisdom&#x2014;and parents who can give their son a little push. With two rabbis to work with, Sheinkin has ample opportunity to do what he does best: reworking Midrash, Jewish folktales, and Talmudic lore. Particularly fun is seeing the Wise Fools of Chelm relocated to Helm Falls, where they&#x2019;ve just hung the baker for murder (he didn&#x2019;t do it&#x2014;the blacksmith did&#x2014;but Helm Falls only has one blacksmith, and there weretwo bakers). The illustrations feature deadpan characters and flat prairie colors; both match the droll, understated telling. Excellent sourcing moves readers to other stories, but they might not be as much fun without Harvey.

Many believe it to be the genuine burial shroud of Jesus Christ. Some hypothesize the image on the shroud was created through a rare scientific phenomenon.

Wilcox<br>Is the shroud of Turin&#x2014;an ancient linen bearing the mysterious image of a man, purported to be Jesus of Nazareth&#x2014;the ingenious work of an artist, or the true shroud of Christ? For centuries, this question has perplexed and enticed the most brilliant minds. Now, in <i>The Truth about the Shroud of Turin: Solving the Mystery</i>, journalist Robert K. Wilcox investigates every aspect of the shroud&#x2019;s history, from the ancient Egyptian weave of the cloth to the possible role of radiation in forming the image on its surface.

Finland's fight to defend her independence earned this tiny nation of just 3 million people a distinct place in history. Invaded by Stalin before World War II, Finland held out for months and inflicted huge losses on the invaders, but she was eventually crushed by the weight of Soviet numbers. When Germany invaded the USSR in 1941 the Finns fought alongside the Wehrmacht on the northern Russian Front, with great skill and courage in an attempt to regain their lost territories. When the German armies were forced to retreat in 1944, Finland managed to conclude a separate peace with the USSR &#x2013; uniquely, without being forced to accept renewed Russian occupation. This book details the organisation, uniforms and equipment of this remarkable force.</p><p>Philip Jowett was born in Leeds in 1961, and has been interested in military history for as long as he can remember.

Probably composed between 1372 and 1389, the poem survives in three distinct versions. It is known to modern readers largely through the middle of the three, the so-called B-text. Now, George Economou's verse translation of the poet's third version makes available for the first time in modern English the final revision of a work that many have regarded as the greatest Christian poem in our language.</p><p>Langland's remarkable powers of invention and his passionate involvement with the spiritual, social, and political crises of his time lay claim to our attention, and demand serious comparison with Dante's Divine Comedy. Economou's translation preserves the intensity of the poet's verse and the narrative energy of his alliterative long line, the immediacy of the original's story of the quest for salvation, and the individuality of its language and wordplay.</p></p><p>George Economou is Professor of English at the University of Oklahoma in Norman.

Armed with youthful self-importance, makeshift slave costumes, righteous zeal, and their own misguided ideas about the South, the 4 Little Indians descend on Braggsville. Their journey through backwoods churches, backroom politics, Waffle Houses, and drunken family barbecues is uproarious to start, but will have devastating consequences.</p><p>With the keen wit of <em>Billy Lynn&#x2019;s Long Halftime Walk</em> and the deft argot of <em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em>, T.

Michelle Belanger, the author of Psychic Vampire Codex, takes readers on an adventure into the subconscious world of dreams, territory that no amount of psychology or research has fully charted. This absorbing account, beginning with the author&#39;s own first experience of dreamwalking in a school bus as a child, both explains the phenomenon and teaches the techniques of dreamwalking. Learn to set up a dream space and a dream gate. Harness your dreaming mind to visit distant family members, pass vital messages to friends, even start secret trysts with your lover! Nobody knows exactly what happens when we dream, but practicing dreamwalking can and will open a whole new world in which the connections between ourselves and our spirit selves and others, as well as the meaning of dreams and the relationship of dreaming to other energy work and magick become clear.</p><p>Michelle Belanger&#39;s childhood could be a story straight from Ray Bradbury&#39;s October Country&#34;. Her small Midwest town featured a haunted public library, and it celebrated the return of flights of turkey vultures every year on the Ides of March. Her home life was stranger still. Raised by her maternal grandmother, psychic experiences and ghostly phenomenon were common occurrences in the Belanger household -- but were only discussed behind closed doors. Her estranged grandfather&#39;s family included healers, tea-leaf readers, and circus freaks who openly embraced their extraordinary gifts. Afflicted with a life-threatening heart defect from birth, Michelle endured both out of body experiences and near death experiences before the age of five. Her mother believed that these traumatic brushes with death made Michelle more sensitive to psychic phenomenon. Michelle herself believes that her skills arise from a combination of genetics, environment, and fate.</p><h2>Heated: A Most Wanted Novel</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER �&nbsp;For fans of<i> Release Me</i> comes a series of three enigmatic and powerful men, and the striking women who can bring them to their knees.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b><i>I knew better than to risk my heart.</i>&nbsp;<i>But fierce passion comes at a high price.</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> I grew up believing in right and wrong, good and evil, black and white.

And more important, do I want to?<br><br>Nothing is ever as easy as it should be.<br><br>My dad taught me that. He served as a special agent with the FBI for twenty years before leaving that post to become the chief of police in Galveston, Texas, an island community with enough crime to keep his life interesting, and enough sunshine and warm weather to keep him happy.<br><br>During the years I was growing up, I&#x2019;d watch as he spent hours, days, weeks, even months putting together a kick-�ass case against some of the vilest criminals that ever walked this earth. Thousands of man hours. Hundreds of pieces of evidence. All those little ducks lined up just the way they should be&#x2014;�and it didn&#x2019;t make one bit of difference. The defense would spout some technicality, the judge would cave, and poof, all that work went down the drain.<br><br>Like I said, nothing is ever easy. That&#x2019;s the first truism upon which I base my life.<br><br>The second is a corollary: No one is what they seem.<br><br>My stepfather taught me that. He was a fast-�rising major league baseball player that the press took a liking to. They called him the golden boy, predicted he&#x2019;d spearhead his team to the World Series, and did everything but genuflect when he entered a room. What they didn&#x2019;t report was the way he beat my mother. The way he forced me to watch, threatening that my turn was coming. His hands, his fists, a broken beer bottle. Whatever was handy. I&#x2019;d flinch with every blow, and when her bones snapped, I&#x2019;d feel it too, and my scream would blend with hers in some horrific, discordant melody.<br><br>Somehow none of those hospital visits were ever reported in the local paper, and on the rare occasions when the cops showed up at our house, nothing ever came of it. Harvey Grier had the face of a prince and the smile of a homecoming king, and if his fourteen-�year-�old stepdaughter called the cops one night with a bullshit story that could ruin his reputation and queer his lucrative deals, it must be because she was your typical bored teenager. Certainly it couldn&#x2019;t be that she lived with the monster day in and day out, and saw all too clearly under the pretty boy disguise.<br><br>My stepfather is dead now. As far as I was concerned, that was a good thing.

And hard.<br><br>The takeaway? Don&#x2019;t take anything for granted. And don&#x2019;t trust anyone.<br><br>I guess that makes me cynical. But it also makes me a damn good cop.<br><br>I sipped champagne and thought about my job and those two axioms as I leaned against one of the white draped pillars in The Drake hotel&#x2019;s cloyingly elegant Palm Court restaurant. I didn&#x2019;t know a soul there, primarily because I&#x2019;d crashed the party, and I was doing my best to blend with that pillar so that I could simply sit back and watch the world&#x2014;�and the people&#x2014;�go by. I was looking for one face in particular, because I&#x2019;d come here with a plan. And I intended to stay in my little corner, holding this pillar, until I spied my mark.<br><br>I&#x2019;d been standing there for an hour, and was beginning to think that I had a long night ahead. But I&#x2019;d survived worse stakeouts, and I am nothing if not determined.<br><br>I&#x2019;d been to the Palm Court once before when my dad had me for a weekend and we decided to have an adventure. But tonight most of the familiar tables had been moved out, giving the guests room to mingle around the elegant fountain and massive floral arrangement. As far as I could tell, the dress code for the evening was anything that had premiered during Fashion Week, and the only reason no one was pointing a finger at me and snickering was that my off-�the-�clearance-�rack dress was so utterly pedestrian that it rendered me invisible.<br><br>Flowing strains of classical music filled the room, provided by an orchestra tucked into the corner, but no one was dancing. Instead they were mingling. Talking, laughing. It was all very proper. Very elegant. Very festive.<br><br>And I was very much out of my element.<br><br>My natural habitat is Indiana, where I&#x2019;m actually a bit of a celebrity within the force as the youngest female ever to make detective with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. I&#x2019;d come to Chicago because I&#x2019;d been going out of my mind while I rode out a stint on medical leave, and when one of my confidential informants, Candy, asked me to track down her former roommate who&#x2019;d fallen off the planet, I&#x2019;d decided to do a little off-�the-�books investigation.<br><br>According to Candy, Amy had been working as an exotic dancer at an upscale Chicago gentleman&#x2019;s club called Destiny until about two weeks ago. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d been there almost a month and was jamming on the tips. She even liked the other girls. And I&#x2019;m pretty sure she was banging one of the owners. So it wasn&#x2019;t like she had a reason to just split.&#x201d;<br><br>To my way of thinking, banging the boss might be reason enough, especially if the boss is the one who told you to move on.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but she would have told me,&#x201d; Candy said, when I suggested as much. &#x201c;She might take another job or even move, but she&#x2019;d call once she got settled. Something happened.&#x201d;<br><br>Normally, I wouldn&#x2019;t worry. After all, twenty-�two-�year-�old exotic dancers pull up stakes and disappear all the time. Maybe they&#x2019;re just trying to shake off the old life. Or maybe they&#x2019;re following a guy. Amy had been on her own since she was fifteen and knew how to handle herself. She was clean, so I didn&#x2019;t expect that she was laid out in a heroin den somewhere. Plus, I knew she fantasized about Prince Charming riding in and whisking her off into the sunset, so maybe she&#x2019;d realized that banging the owner wasn&#x2019;t going to stick, and she&#x2019;d set out for New York or Vegas or someplace else with a surfeit of rich, horny men.<br><br>But I didn&#x2019;t believe any of that. Candy had been more than seven months pregnant when Amy moved to Chicago, full of promises to come back loaded down with presents for the baby and, most important, to be there for the birth. Assuming the kid came on schedule, that was just over two weeks away.<br><br>I hoped to hell she&#x2019;d just gotten carried away with a guy and would surface any day now with stories of hot nights and wild sex. But I worked homicide, and it was in my nature to fear the worst.<br><br>While I was making the drive from Indiana to Chicago, I&#x2019;d put in a call to a friend in the Chicago PD, and he&#x2019;d confirmed that she wasn&#x2019;t cooling her heels in a Cook County cage. I was somewhat relieved to know she was either staying clean or playing it smart, but I&#x2019;d secretly hoped that she&#x2019;d gotten arrested for shoplifting and was too proud to call Candy for bail.<br><br>I&#x2019;d rolled into Chicago just after seven on a Wednesday night, and I&#x2019;d made Destiny my first stop. The place was clean and classy, with drinks that weren&#x2019;t watered down, girls who looked happy to be there and not at all used up, and a clientele that skewed heavily toward the professional end of the spectrum. The place had a full bar, including Guinness on tap, and a decent menu that included some rather delicious cheese fries.<br><br>I&#x2019;d certainly seen worse places, and as I sat at the bar and looked the joint over with a cop&#x2019;s eye, nothing wonky popped for me.<br><br>Enter the Second Truism: No one is what they seem. Or, in this case, no place is what it seems.<br><br>I learned that when I met Agent Kevin Warner, an FBI buddy, for breakfast the next morning and he laid out a whole list of bad-�ass shit that he thought was going down in that club. He tossed allegations around like candy. And when he hit the Mann Act charges&#x2014;�prostitution, white slavery, and other nasty felonies&#x2014;�my ears perked up.<br><br>&#x201c;Slow down, cowboy,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;They got busted for that shit?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fucking immunity,&#x201d; Kevin said. &#x201c;They helped shut down a white slavery ring that was working off the West Coast and spreading all the way toward our fair city.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They?&#x201d; I repeated.<br><br>&#x201c;Black, August, and Sharp,&#x201d; he said, naming off Destiny&#x2019;s three owners&#x2014;�three celebrated businessmen who were the toast of Chicago. I mean, hell. I&#x2019;m not even from Chicago, and I knew all about those guys. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re slick, those three,&#x201d; Kevin continued. &#x201c;Slick and smart and as dangerous as sharks in dark water. Got the immunity deal to hide behind, and that cut my investigation off at the knees.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. Immunity was part of the game. The whole point was to protect a suspect from prosecution. If there wasn&#x2019;t guilt there in the first place, that protection really wasn&#x2019;t necessary. In other words, it was a rare suspect who was given immunity without being dirty.<br><br>Frankly, the whole idea of giving a suspect immunity irritated me, but I knew it was a necessary evil. Besides, I figured that justice would find a way. At least that was what my dad always said when one of his defendants pulled a technicality out of their ass and shot the finger at the law.<br><br>Karma really could be a raving bitch, and I wondered if she was baring her teeth in the direction of Black, August, and Sharp. Were they as dirty as Kevin said? Were they simply good citizens who shared their knowledge with the Feds? Or were they somewhere in the middle?<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know, but I figured the odds ran toward the first or the last. &#x201c;How broad&#x2019;s the immunity?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d asked.<br><br>&#x201c;If I have my way, they&#x2019;ll wish it was broader. I&#x2019;m dead certain they&#x2019;re neck deep in all sorts of shit. Gambling, smuggling, money laundering. Bribery, kickbacks, fraud. You name it, they&#x2019;re in it. But they&#x2019;ve got powerful friends, and I&#x2019;m not authorized to officially pursue any of it.&#x201d;<br><br>I heard the frustration in his voice. He wanted these guys&#x2014;�wanted them bad. I got that. There were a lot of reasons I&#x2019;d become a cop, but in the end it all boiled down to protecting the innocent and stopping the bad guys. To making sure the system worked and that those who crossed that line paid for the breach.<br><br>I lived and breathed my job. It was both my redemption and my salvation. And I was very good at what I did.</p><h2>Washington</h2><p>With <i>Washington</i>, the illustrious longtime editorial page editor of <i>The Washington Post</i> wrote an instant classic, a sociology of Washington, D.C., that is as wise as it is wry. Greenfield, a recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for commentary, wrote the book secretly in the final two years of her life. She told her literary executor, presidential historian Michael Beschloss, of her work and he has written an afterword telling the story of how the book came into being. Greenfield's close friend and employer, the late Katharine Graham, contributed a moving and personal foreword. Greenfield came to Washington in 1961, at the beginning of the Kennedy administration and joined <i>The Washington Post</i> in 1968. Her editorials at the <i>Post</i> and her columns in <i>Newsweek</i>, were universally admired in Washington for their insight and style. In this, her first book, Greenfield provides a portrait of the U.S. capital at the end of the American century. It is an eccentric, tribal, provincial place where the primary currency is power. For all the scandal and politics of Washington, its real culture is surprisingly little known. Meg Greenfield explains the place with an insider's knowledge and an observer's cool perspective.</p><p>Meg Greenfield is one of the legends of Washington, D.C. For more than three decades as a columnist and editor, writes Katharine Graham in a loving foreword, "she helped create the institutional voice of the <i>Washington Post</i>." This book, written secretly in the final two years of her life and now published posthumously, is a wonderfully incisive piece of work. Greenfield really understood the city she came to settle in, and she really understood people. Her observations are sharp and profound: <blockquote> Public people almost eagerly dehumanize themselves. They allow the markings of region, family, class, individual character, and, generally, personhood that they once possessed to be leached away. At the same time, they construct a new public self that often does terrible damage to what remains of the genuine person. That is not because people here are bad or set out in the first place to become phonies, but rather because high politics in the city seems to reward the transformation. It is regarded as a measure of competence and required as a condition of success. </blockquote> She has plenty to say about the media: "Journalists who persist in regarding themselves as thoroughly clean and the world around them as thoroughly dirty are guilty of more than misplaced moral vanity. They are also in danger of rendering themselves incapable of plausibly explaining what they are covering--except as further implied evidence of their own virtue." Greenfield was a powerful Washingtonian, but like so many Washingtonians--not least the elected lawmakers--she came from somewhere else (in her case, Seattle). In many ways, this book is a guide to keeping from going native, or, as historian Michael Beschloss nicely puts in an afterword, "how to live at the center of political and journalistic influence in Washington without losing your principles, detachment, or individual human qualities." <i>Washington</i> is part memoir, but mostly observation by a keen watcher and analysis by an acute mind. It stands to become a small classic on life in America's capital and, in a way, life anywhere. <i>--John J.

She has been portrayed as a penitent whore, a wealthy woman, Christ&#x2019;s wife, an adulteress, a symbol of the frailty of women, and an object of veneration. And, to this day, she remains a potent and mysterious figure.<em></em></p><p>In the manner of a quest, this book follows Mary Magdalene through the centuries, explores how she has been reinterpreted for every age, and examines what she herself reveals about woman and man and the divine. It seeks the real Mary Magdalene in the New Testament and in the gnostic gospels, where she is extolled as the chief disciple of Christ. It investigates how and why the Church recast her as a fallen woman, traces her story through the Renaissance when she became a goddess of beauty and love, and looks at Mary Magdalene as the feminist icon she has become today.</p><p>Historian and writer Michael Haag has written widely on the Egyptian, Classical,and Medieval worlds.

By looking at massacres in schools and offices as post-industrial rebellions, Mark Ames is able to juxtapose the historical place of rage in America with the social climate after Reaganomics began to effect worker's paychecks. But why high schools? Why post offices? Mark Ames examines the most fascinating and unexpected cases, crafting a convincing argument for workplace massacres as modern day slave rebellions. Like slave rebellions, rage massacres are doomed, gory, sometimes inadvertently comic, and grossly misunderstood. Going Postal seeks to contextualize this violence in a world where working isn't and doesn&#x2019;t pay what it used to. Part social critique and part true crime page-turner, Going Postal answers the questions asked by commentators on the nightly news and films such as Bowling for Columbine.</p><p></p><h2>Genesis And Exodus</h2><p>One of the basic resource library&nbsp;books for the Disciple:&nbsp; Into&nbsp;The Word Into The World program that is used weekly by group members for reading, study, and research.&nbsp;<br> <ul> <li>Genesis and Exodus </li> <li>Harper Collins Bible Dictionary </li> <li>NDSB Gospel Of Luke </li> <li>NDSB Acts Of The Apostles </li> <li>Oxford Bible Atlas </li> <li>Jews And Christians A Troubled Family </li> <li>Assignment Sheets </li> </ul></p><p></p><h2>Tale of the Witch Doll (Penny Parker #1): The Penny Parker Mysteries</h2><p>Penny Parker starred in a series of 17 books written by Mildred A.

The reactor core of the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl began to melt, setting into motion the greatest nuclear disaster of the twentieth century. While Europe slept, a cloud laden with radiation traveled thousands of miles in every direction, contaminating five million people who were unaware of its danger and unable to protect themselves. At the time, Emmanuel Lepage was 19 years old, watching and listening to the news reported on television.<br><br>22 years later, in April 2008, a group of nuclear energy-adverse activists and artists visit Chernobyl to document the lives of survivors and their children living on the highly contaminated land. Sent to sketch brutal landscapes of disaster and the folly of man, Lepage is surprised at the unexpected beauty he encounters. Often wondering to himself: What am I doing here?</p><p><b>Emmanuel Lepage</b> was born in 1966 in Saint-Brieuc.

Part of the answer lies in the design of public policy that unmistakenly works to advance citizenship by listening to, educating, and involving ordinary people. Rather than serve mainly the narrow interests of powerful groups who are socially constructed as "deserving" or issuing discipline and punishment to powerless people socially constructed as "undeserving," public policy needs to advance citizenship, solve problems, pursue justice, and balance the interests of individuals with a concern for the collective good.<br><br><i>Policy Design for Democracy</i> is a theoretically sophisticated work that draws examples from a wide array of public policy arenas. It summarizes four current approaches to policy theory-pluralism, policy sciences, public choice, and critical theory-and shows how none offers more than a partial view of the policy design characteristics that support and perpetuate democracy. Schneider and Ingram then develop a theory of public policymaking predicated on understanding how differences in policy designs are related to differences in the contexts from which they emerge and how these designs have an impact on democracy.<br><br>One of the first books to examine systematically the substantive aspects of public policy, <i>Policy Design for Democracy</i> is written clearly and with sufficient examples to make it easily understandable by undergraduates. Its linkage of public policy to citizenship is an important antidote to the overly technical and goal-driven orientation adopted by the policy sciences and public choice, and to the overly self-interested and strategic political games found in pluralist theory. Schneider and Ingram close by recommending a series of reforms that will improve policy designs and help restore citizen confidence in government.</p><p>"This is a policy textbook with point of view and attitude. It will influence the next generation of students (graduates and undergraduates alike) and it will have to be taken with utmost seriousness by scholars, practitioners, and politicians."--Theodore Lowi, author of <i>American Government and The End of Liberalism</i> <p>"Schneider and Ingram have resynthesized the policy literature around one central question: how do various elements of policy design and policy making help or hinder democracy? And in their new bottles, the old wine really does taste better."--Deborah A. Stone, author of <i>The Disabled State</i> and <i>Policy Paradox and Political Reason</i> </p><p>"This superb review, critique, and synthesis of policy theory will enable everyone concerned with public policy, whether as practitioner, teacher, or student, not only to understand the process better and be more effective, but to think clearly about the values on which policy should be built."--John Mollenkopf, author of <i>A Phoenix in the Ashes</i> </p><p>"It is time for intelligent optimism in political science, and Schneider and Ingram serve us well. Their formulation of 'policy design' wonderfully reminds us that policy has content and not mere form. They offer a framework that seeks to overcome degenerative policymaking, of which there is surely enough, and to achieve constructive results through democratic means. It is Lasswellian in spirit, but also reminds one of Norton Long."--Matthew Holden, Jr., author of <i>Continuity and Disruption</i></p>Anne Larason Schneider is dean of the College of Public Programs at Arizona State University. <p>Helen Ingram holds the Warmington Endowed Chair in the School of Social Ecology and is a profesor in the Department of Society and Politics, University of California, Irvine.</p></p><h2>Life, the Universe and Everything</h2><p>The unhappy inhabitants of planet Krikkit are sick of looking at the night sky above their heads&#x2013;so they plan to destroy it.

Then Jackie&#x2019;s thirty-eight-page will was read. Lee discovered that substantial cash bequests were left to family members, friends, and employees&#x2014;but nothing to her. "I have made no provision in this my Will for my sister, Lee B. Radziwill, for whom I have great affection, because I have already done so during my lifetime," read Jackie&#x2019;s final testament. Drawing on the authors&#x2019; candid interviews with Lee Radziwill,<em> The Fabulous Bouvier Sisters</em> explores their complicated relationship, placing them at the center of twentieth-century fashion, design, and style.</p><p>In life, Jackie and Lee were alike in so many ways. Both women had a keen eye for beauty&#x2014;in fashion, design, painting, music, dance, sculpture, poetry&#x2014;and both were talented artists. Both loved pre-revolutionary Russian culture, and the blinding sunlight, calm seas, and ancient olive groves of Greece. Both loved the siren call of the Atlantic, sharing sweet, early memories of swimming with the rakish father they adored, Jack Vernou Bouvier, at his East Hampton retreat. But Jackie was her father&#x2019;s favorite, and Lee, her mother&#x2019;s. One would grow to become the most iconic woman of her time, while the other lived in her shadow. As they grew up, the two sisters developed an extremely close relationship threaded with rivalry, jealousy, and competition. Yet it was probably the most important relationship of their lives.</p><p>For the first time, <em>Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor Sam Kashner and acclaimed biographer Nancy Schoenberger tell the complete story of these larger-than-life sisters.

All are chronicled in a new chapter which, with a section of completely up-to-date color photographs, makes this edition a must.<br></p><p>Originally written in 1986 in anticipation of the 75th anniversary of the Titanic disaster, <i>Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy</i> was issued in a second edition in 1994, after the authors got a chance to explore the wreckage. They added some haunting color photographs and extra text in which they muse on the emotional impact of what they call the "artefacts" retrieved: an ivory hairbrush with hair caught in its bristles, a legible newspaper, and a business card with a phone number scribbled in pencil on the back. In its boxy photographic layout and sober prose, the book feels like a historic artifact itself. The authors scrupulously avoid any trace of modern hype, letting the quietly stated facts speak for themselves: the ship was the largest moving manmade object of its day; on the proud clock in the grand first-class entryway, the allegorical figure of Time was flanked by Honour and Glory; one intrepid old lady saved fellow passengers by locating them in the waves with the flashlight built into her cane. "With more than 1500 still on board," the authors write, "and just 47 available spaces in collapsible [lifeboat] D, [Officer] Lightoller instructs the crew to lock arms and form a circle around the boat. Only women and children are permitted to pass through that circle." This book gives a sense of what it might have been like to enter that circle--or be excluded.Eight decades after the sinking of the Titanic, with the loss of more than 1,500 lives, the public&#39;s fascination with the ship, the tragedy and its mysterious aftermath remains as strong as ever. The new edition of this highly respected book offers a comprehensive chronicle of the entire saga, from the liner&#39;s design as the supposedly safest vessel afloat, through her maiden voyage carrying the social, artistic and financial elite of two continents, and her sinking in the early hours of 15 April 1912. It continues up to the discovery of the wreck in 1985, the controversy surrounding the recovering of artifacts from the vessel and an account of their conservation and preservation. John Eaton and Charles Haas, two renowned Titanic experts, have themselves dived down to the wreck. Their exclusive seabed photographs form the basis of a new and fascinating color section. Also featured in this updated and expanded edition is an additional chapter covering the 1985 discovery, the 1986 crewed exploration, the 1987 artifact recovery, the 1991 cinematic expedition, and the 1993 research and recovery expedition. Coverage of the 1992 British Ministry of Transport&#39;s reassessment of evidence dealing with the Californian, together with the most detailed passenger list yet published, further enhance the book&#39;s acclaimed comprehensiveness. The Titanic was one of the best photographed vessels of all time. Here is an astonishingly thorough pictorial record of her brief existence. Beginning with her conception, more than a thousand photographs and artists&#39; impressions cover her construction and launching, her fitting-out and trials, preparations for her maiden passenger-carrying voyage, her departure fromSouthampton and arrival at Cherbourg, her voyage to Queenstown, and the drama of her final disaster after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic, and the aftermath through to the present day. There are photos of her designers and builders, her passengers and crew, and of other vessels in her vicinity when she sank, including the Carpathia and the Californian. Also featured are astonishing pictures of the wreck two and a half miles beneath the sea. There are sections on the American and British inquiries and on the world&#39;s memorials to the Titanic and her people.</p><h2>Her First American</h2><p>She&#x2019;s Ilka Weissnix, a young Jewish refugee from Hitler&#x2019;s Europe, newly arrived in the United States.

When the deadly succubus queen's war on Mineral City provides enough death energy for the powerful Dragon to escape its prison between the planes of reality, Thorn is pulled between the demands of the ultra-lawful Administration of the ArchSeraph and its rivals, the Earth Invasion Heretics, who claim to know the origins of seraphs and demons and the whereabouts of Thorn's missing twin, Rose. Hunter's world continues to expand in this highly original fantasy with lively characters where nothing can ever be taken for granted. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These words provided generations of American Christians with the justification for physically disciplining their children, in ways that range from spankings to brutal beatings. This learned and deeply disturbing work of history examines both the religious roots of corporal punishment in America and its consequences -- in the minds of children, in adults, and in our national tendencies toward authoritarian and apocalyptic thinking. Drawing on sources as old as Cotton Mather and as current as today&#39;s headlines, Spare the Child is one of those rare works of scholarship that have the power to change our lives.</p><p>This is a richly researched, acutely unsettling study of corporal punishment in the United States. It focuses on the &#34;Christian&#34; use of Biblical texts to justify corporal punishment and its destructive legacy in our culture. Greven&#39;s insightful scholarship traces rationales for parental brutality through generations of religious apocalyptic thinking. His forceful argument takes the issue of physical discipline from the realm of parental rights and tradition and makes finding an alternative a moral responsibility.&#34;One of the most articulate and persuasive arguments against the physical punishment of children available.&#34; --Richard J.

The terrifying high-altitude flights of James Glaisher helped to establish the science of meteorology as well as the notion of a fragile planet, while balloons were also used to observe the horrors of modern battle during the American Civil War. Here too are the many writers&#x2014;Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens, Jules Verne, and more&#x2014;who felt the imaginative impact of flight and allowed it to soar in their work. Holmes tells the history of ballooning from every angle&#x2014;scientific to poetic&#x2014;through the adventurers and entrepreneurs, scientists and escapists, heroes and fools who were possessed by the longing to be airborne.<br><br>(With 24 pages of color illustrations, and black-and-white illustrations throughout.)</p><p><p><b>RICHARD HOLMES</b> is the author of <i>The Age of Wonder,</i> which was short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction, won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books and the National Books Critics Circle Award, and was one of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>&#x2019;s Best Books of the Year in 2009.

He was awarded the OBE in 1992. He lives in England.</p>1<br>My own flying dream began at a village fete in Norfolk. I was four years old. My uncle, a tall and usually silent RAF pilot, had bought a red party balloon from a charity stall, and tied it to the top button of my aertex shirt. This was my first balloon, and it seemed to have a mind of its own. It was inflated with helium, which is a gas four times lighter than air, though I did not understand this at the time. It pulled mysteriously and insistently at my button. &#x2018;Maybe you will fly,&#x2019; my uncle remarked. He led me up a grassy bank so we could look over the whole fete. Below me stretched the little tents, the stalls, the show ring with its bales of straw and small dancing horses. Above me bobbed the big red balloon, gleaming and beautiful, blotting out the sun. It bounced off the top of my head, making a strange springy sound, full of distance. It tugged me impatiently towards the sky, and I began to feel unsteady on my feet. I felt that I was falling &#x2013; upwards. Then my uncle let go of my hand, and my dream began. <br>&nbsp;<br>2<br>Throughout history, dreamlike stories and romantic adventures have always attached themselves to balloons. Some are factual, some are pure fantasy, many (the most interesting) are a provoking mixture of the two. But some kind of <i>narrative basket </i>always seems to come tantalisingly suspended beneath them. Show me a balloon and I&#x2019;ll show you a story; quite often a tall one. And very frequently it is a story of courage in the face of imminent catastrophe. <br>&nbsp;<br>What&#x2019;s more, all balloon flights are naturally three-act dramas. The First Act is the launch: the human drama of plans, hopes, expectations. The Second Act is the flight itself: the realities, the visions, the possible discoveries. The Final Act is the landing, the least predictable, most perilous part of any ascent, which may bring triumph or disaster or (quite often) farce. The ultimate nature of any particular balloon ascent &#x2013; a pastoral, a tragedy, a comedy, a melodrama, even a sitcom &#x2013; is never clear until the balloon is safely back on earth. Sometimes it is not clear even then. <br>&nbsp;<br>Even the well-known fable of the Cretan engineer Daedalus and his young son Icarus, so oft en retold as the Genesis myth of flying, is curiously ambiguous in its outcome. It appears originally in Book VIII of Ovid&#x2019;s long poem <i>Metamorphoses</i>, &#x2018;The Transformations&#x2019;, completed two thousand years ago, around 8 A.D. Having constructed wings for both of them, Daedalus and son launch into the empyrean together, but famously the impetuous Icarus flies too high; the wax joints of his feathered wings melt &#x2018;in the scorching heat of the sun&#x2019;, and he tumbles down into the sea. Yet this primal legend of flight is more complex than it might appear.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is often forgotten that in the same Book VIII of Ovid&#x2019;s poem, Daedalus also has a twelve-year-old nephew (the son of his sister) called Perdix. Perdix is a brilliant and precocious child inventor, loved by all in Crete. But Daedalus, in a crazed fit of grief and jealousy after the death of Icarus, hurls Perdix &#x2018;headlong down from the sacred hill of Minerva&#x2019;. Yet unlike Icarus, Perdix does not crash to earth and die. Instead, he takes to the air and flies with divine aid: &#x2018;Pallas Athene, the goddess who fosters all talent in art and craft, caught him and turned him, still in midair, to a fluttering bird and covered his body with feathers, so the strength of his quick intelligence sprang into his wings and feet.&#x2019; He becomes Perdix, the partridge (<i>perdrix </i>in French), a child who has indeed learned to fly successfully &#x2013; although unlike Icarus he always remains close to the ground, &#x2018;and does not build his nest in mountain crags&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>What may happen while actually aloft is equally mysterious. Balloons have always given a remarkable bird&#x2019;s-eye or angel&#x2019;s-eye view of the world. They are unusual instruments of contemplation, and even speculation. They provide unexpected visions of the earth beneath. To the earliest aeronauts they displayed great natural features like rivers, mountains, forests, lakes, waterfalls, and even polar regions, in an utterly new light. But they also showed human features: the growth of the new industrial cities, the speed and violence of modern warfare, or the expansion of imperial exploration.<br>&nbsp;<br>Long before the arrival of the aeroplane in the twentieth century, balloons gave the first physical glimpse of a planetary overview. Balloons contributed to the sciences and the arts that first suggested that we are all guests aboard a unified, living world. The nature of the upper air, the forecasting of weather, the evolutions of geology, the development of international communications, the power of propaganda, the creations of science fiction, even the development of extra-terrestrial travel itself, are an integral part of balloon history.<br>&nbsp;<br>But there are also stranger, existential elements, far less easy to define. The mental release, the physical heart-lift, the calm perilous delight of ballooning &#x2013; an early aeronaut described it as &#x2018;hilarity&#x2019; &#x2013; is an absolute revelation, but one not easily or convincingly described. I have tried to capture its spirit indirectly, by tying together this cluster of true balloon stories and colourful tales, from the vast &#x2018;history and lore of aerostation&#x2019;, in the hope that they will bear us aloft for a little while.<br>&nbsp;<br>While airborne, they may also provide a new perspective. The vulnerable globe of balloon fabric is itself symbolically related to the vulnerable globe of the whole earth. There is some haunting analogy between the silken skin of a balloon, the thin &#x2018;onion skin&#x2019; of safety, and the thin atmospheric skin of our whole, beautiful planet as it floats in space. This thin breathable layer of air is not much more than seven miles thick &#x2013; as balloonists were the first to discover. In every way, balloons make you catch your breath.</p><h2>Flying the SR-71 Blackbird: In the Cockpit on a Secret Operational Mission</h2><p><b>For anyone who has ever wondered what it's like to fly the SR-71 on a secret Mach 3 reconnaissance mission, this book has the answer.

Like perhaps a quarter of the population, Grenville reacts badly to the artificial fragrances around us: other people&#x2019;s perfumes, and all those scented cosmetics, cleaning products, and air fresheners. On a book tour in 2015, dogged by ill health, she started wondering: What&#x2019;s in fragrance? Who tests it for safety? What does it do to people? </p> <p>The more Grenville investigated, the more she felt this was a story that should be told. The chemicals in fragrance can be linked not only to short-term problems like headaches and asthma, but to long-term ones like hormone disruption and cancer. Yet products can be released onto the market without testing. They&#x2019;re regulated only by the same people who make and sell them. And the ingredients don&#x2019;t even have to be named on the label. </p> <p>This book is based on careful research into the science of scent and the power of the fragrance industry. But, as you&#x2019;d expect from an acclaimed novelist, it&#x2019;s also accessible and personal. <em>The Case Against Fragrance</em> will make you see&#x2015;and smell&#x2015;the world differently. </p> <p><strong>Kate Grenville </strong>is one of Australia&#x2019;s most celebrated writers.

From across the countryside patients and their desperate families come to seek treatment for unconventional diseases from an unconventional doctor. His secret? Treating the diseases of the occult. <br><br>Though Fortune wrote <i>The Secrets of Doctor Taverner</i> as her first novel, she maintained that all the events were based on true occurrences.

A prolific writer, pioneer psychologist, powerful psychic, and spiritualist, she dedicated her life to the revival of the Western Mystery Tradition. She was also a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, whose members included at various times such people as A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, and W. B. Yeats."Originally a series of ten short stories, this subsequent compilation became Dion Fortune's first novel. It began her tradition of using fiction as a teaching tool. She claimed that the tales were based on real occurrences and many believe it is an account of her relationship with her own metaphysical mentor. Whether it is fact or fiction is irrelevant. It's a classic paranormal adventure story, recounted by one of the pillars of the Western Mystery Tradition. In her foreword, Diana Paxson puts the book into the context of supernatural literary history for us. She also likens Fortune's genius doctor to both Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes. The book remains timely and fun, and Fortune remains one of the great metaphysical communicators." -<b>Anna Jedrziewski</b>, <i>New Age Retailer</i> July 2011</p><h2>Lights on a Ground of Darkness: An Evocation of a Place and Time</h2><p>Like the yellow, pink, and blue irises that had been transplanted from house to house over the years, the stories of poet Ted Kooser&#x2019;s family had been handed down until, as his mother lay ill and dying, he felt an urgency to write them down.

He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned.</p><p>Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 <i>Parallel Lives</i>, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators. Plutarch's many other varied extant works, about 60 in number, are known as <i>Moralia</i> or Moral Essays. They are of high literary value, besides being of great use to people interested in philosophy, ethics and religion.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of the <i>Moralia</i> is in fifteen volumes, volume XIII having two parts.</p></p><p><p>Frank Cole Babbitt (1867&#x2013;1935) was the Hobart Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Trinity College, Hartford.</p></p><h2>Oil on the Brain: Petroleum&#39;s Long, Strange Trip to Your Tank</h2><p><i>Oil on the Brain</i> is a smart, surprisingly funny account of the oil industry&#x2014;the people, economies, and pipelines that bring us petroleum, brilliantly illuminating a world we encounter every day.<br><br>Americans buy ten thousand gallons of gasoline a second, without giving it much of a thought. Where does all this gas come from? Lisa Margonelli&#x2019;s desire to learn took her on a one-hundred thousand mile journey from her local gas station to oil fields half a world away. In search of the truth behind the myths, she wriggled her way into some of the most off-limits places on earth: the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the New York Mercantile Exchange&#x2019;s crude oil market, oil fields from Venezuela, to Texas, to Chad, and even an Iranian oil platform where the United States fought a forgotten one-day battle. <br><br>In a story by turns surreal and alarming, Margonelli meets lonely workers on a Texas drilling rig, an oil analyst who almost gave birth on the NYMEX trading floor, Chadian villagers who are said to wander the oil fields in the guise of lions, a Nigerian warlord who changed the world price of oil with a single cell phone call, and Shanghai bureaucrats who dream of creating a new Detroit. <br><br>Deftly piecing together the mammoth economy of oil, Margonelli finds a series of stark warning signs for American drivers.</p><p>LISA MARGONELLI is currently an Irvine Fellow at the New America Foundation. She has written for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>Wired</i>, <i>Business 2.0</i>, <i>Discover</i>, and <i>Jane</i>, and was the recipient of a Sundance Institute Fellowship and an excellence in journalism award from the Northern California Society of Professional Journalists. She is based in Oakland, California.<b>1<br>GAS STATION</b>: <b><i>Chasing The Hidden Penny</i></b><br><b>Regular Unleaded $1.61 9/10</b><br><br>Twin Peaks Petroleum sits at a welcoming angle to a busy San Francisco intersection. On this morning in the summer of 2003, a thick fog has crawled over the station, folding each of the eight drivers standing at the pumps in an envelope of cold mist. At the back of the lot sits a garage where a small convenience store glows. On the storefront is a poster of an ebullient snowman clutching a cola, while icicle letters drip the words COLD POP over his head. Inside the convenience store, among the security cameras and parabolic mirrors, the Doritos, cigarettes, and Snapples, jammed into a space no larger than a postal truck, a tall man with dark circles under his eyes appears to doze. His eyelids hang low, twitching; he mumbles; he moves with excruciating deliberation as he counts change.<br><br>I am leaning against a shelf holding several grades of motor oil, individually wrapped strawberry cheesecake muffins, and four flavors of corn nuts: picante, regular, nacho cheese, and ranch. I am no more lively than B. J., the droopy manager. And I am recording the flavors of corn nuts in my notebook to stay awake. &#x201c;Corn Gone Wrong&#x201d; say the packages. I record that too. I&#x2019;ve come to the gas station to watch Americans buy gasoline, as a way of understanding how we fit into the trillion&#x2013;dollar world oil economy. But now that I&#x2019;m here, I realize I&#x2019;ve been here before, bought gas so many times myself I feel there&#x2019;s nothing to see. The fumble, the stuporous swipe of the card, the far&#x2013;off look: I know them well. Gas stations are everywhere, but when you&#x2019;re in one, you&#x2019;re nowhere in particular. Icicle letters are taking shape in my head: WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?<br><br>I keep writing: Trojan spermicidally lubricated snugger fit, two Sominex and a folded paper cup, phone cards, batteries, air fresheners printed to look like ice cream sundaes, a greeting card with a picture of a pansy and the words &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too nice to be sick.&#x201d; The customers standing out at the pumps have a preoccupied, anxious look&#x2014;could they be distracted enough to buy a card that says &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too nice to be sick&#x201d;?<br><b>Gas stations</b> are collections of incidental items, impulses, and routines that seem in themselves to be inconsequential but aggregate into a goliath economy when multiplied by the hungers of 194 million licensed American drivers. Corn nuts, for example, are part of $4.4 billion in salty snacks sold at gas station convenience stores yearly, nearly all impulse buys. The hopeful purchase $25 billion in lottery tickets. People with the sniffles spent $323 million on cold medicine at gas stations in 2001. And the faint smell of gasoline near the pumps? In California alone, the amount of gasoline vapor wafting out of stations, as we fill our cars, totals 15,811 gallons a day&#x2014;roughly the equivalent of two full tanker trucks (1). In the gas station, we&#x2019;ve collaborated to create a culture of speed, convenience, low prices, and 64&#x2013;ounce cup holders, which allow us to express what the industry calls our &#x201c;passion for fountain drinks.&#x201d; Japanese auto executives have hired American anthropologists to explain the mystery of why the purchase of a $40,000 car hangs on the super&#x2013;sizing of the cup holder.<br><br>And then there is the gasoline: 1,143 gallons per household per year, purchased in two&#x2013;and&#x2013;a&#x2013;half&#x2013;minute dashes. We make 16 billion stops at gas stations yearly, taking final delivery on 140 billion gallons of gasoline that has traveled around the world in tanker ships, pipelines, and shiny silver trucks. And then we peel out, get on with our real lives, get back on the highway, or go find a restroom that&#x2019;s open, for Pete&#x2019;s sake.<br><br>With a wave of our powerful credit cards, American drivers buy one-ninth of the world&#x2019;s crude oil production per day. That makes us elephants in the global oil economy&#x2013;our needs are felt around the world, from the tiniest villages in Africa, the Amazon, and the Arctic, to the highest towers in Vienna, Riyadh, and New York. When we lick our lips, they open their taps. When we are in a funk, their governments fall. Here in front of the pump, surrounded by buntings in the joyful colors of children&#x2019;s birthday party balloons, we have the opportunity to be our truest selves in the great, over&#x2013;the&#x2013;top drama/business that is the world oil supply chain.<br><br>But as you know, buying gas can be done by the living dead. Swipe card, insert nozzle, punch the button with the greasy sheen: Gasoline flows into the tank while money flows out of the bank account. Filling a car seems less like making a purchase than a ritual, a formality that isn&#x2019;t quite real.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not even clear what we&#x2019;re buying&#x2014;gasoline&#x2019;s fantastic uniformity means one is as good as another. Water doesn&#x2019;t mix with gas, so beyond occasional traces of vapor, we don&#x2019;t even have to worry about buying substandard gasoline. And all traces of where the fuel came from are completely erased by the time it gets to a gas pump. Texaco gasoline is no longer from Texas, and gas from Unocal is not from &#x201c;Cal.&#x201d; Both companies have been purchased by Chevron, anyway. If gasoline were coffee, we might believe the Baku blend offered a fast but mellow ride.<br><br>As if acknowledging the futility of trying to stand out from the pack when 168,987 gas stations are selling essentially an identical chemical mix, stations have adopted a clannish ugliness. Whether they&#x2019;re in Fairbanks, Alaska, or Pine Island, Florida, they all subscribe to the familiar topography of canopied islands, cheerful plate glass, struggling hedges, and &#x201c;Smile. You&#x2019;re being watched by a surveillance camera&#x201d; signs. Predictable they are, to the very last 9/10ths of a cent, which is permanently printed on every last gas price sign in the land.<br><br>The gas station&#x2019;s blandness is misleading, though. Hidden in its windows, pumps, and hedges are clues to the true nature of the American bargain with gasoline and the enigma of its role in the world.<br><b>On the counter</b> in front of B. J. stands a line of purple plastic wizards, stomachs filled with green candy pebbles. Their shiny eyes stare at me expectantly.<br><br>At the periphery of my vision, a van enters Twin Peaks yard and parks near the fence. In the time it takes the door to slam, B. J. grows a foot taller, loses his paunch, and becomes a man of action. He snaps the countertop open, bounces into the yard, and lands in front of the van driver in one tigerlike swoop. Words are exchanged. The driver sulkily returns to his van and B. J. returns to the store, shaking his head. People try to ditch their cars in the station and take the bus, he explains, taking his position behind the wizards. &#x201c;The customer is always right,&#x201d; says B. J., &#x201c;but bad people going round.&#x201d;<br><br>Like vapors, bad people always seem to be wafting through the gas station. Last week B. J. ran out to stop a truck that was barreling toward the station&#x2019;s lighted canopy. The truck driver ignored him and crunched the canopy. Cars have driven willy nilly through the hedges as he watched. Nightly, people break through the chains on the four entrances. Once he found a gun in the hedge, stashed by a kid on the way to juvenile court. His response? Shave the hedges. Every morning he cleans up garbage, cans, and bottles filled with things we won&#x2019;t discuss. Daily, and constantly, people try to steal: window squeegees, sodas, condoms, money, and phone calls. Behind B. J.&#x2019;s head are the counterfeit $20 bills the station has intercepted.<br><br>People use elaborate schemes to steal gas, he explains. Sometimes they&#x2019;ll pay for $5 and shut the pump off when it reaches $4.75. Then they return to the clerk, telling him to turn the pump back on, knowing that the pumps don&#x2019;t turn off after dispensing amounts less than a dollar. Then they fill their tank and drive off. Others play on the sympathies of the attendant or accuse him of trying to cheat them. In stations where people pump before they pay, they often just drive off. The average gas station loses more than $2,141 a year to gasoline theft. Some lose much more.<br><br>Think of a gas station as a crime scene before the fact, and you&#x2019;ll start to appreciate it as a maze engineered for belligerent rats. Hedges, which I&#x2019;d interpreted as a pathetic attempt at dignity and baronial pretensions, actually eliminate escape routes for would&#x2013;be robbers, limiting holdups. Many convenience stores buy &#x201c;target hardening&#x201d; kits, which include decals imprinted with rulers so that clerks can tell the police how tall the robbers were, two stickers that say &#x201c;No 20s, no 50s,&#x201d; two &#x201c;Thank You&#x201d; decals, and one &#x201c;Smile. You are being watched by our video security.&#x201d;<br><br>Even so, crime is always evolving. &#x201c;After we did target hardening in stores in the 1980s, the crime moved to the pumps&#x2014;carjackings and abductions,&#x201d; says Dr. Rosemary Erickson, a sociologist who&#x2019;s studied gas station crime for thirty years. &#x201c;Now it&#x2019;s public nuisance crimes in the parking lots. Gas stations are considered a magnet.&#x201d; (2) Nearly nine percent of U.S. robberies happen in gas stations and convenience stores, and the average gas station lost $1,749 to robbery in 2004.<br><br>Some of the crimes are not about money at all; they&#x2019;re about freefloating anger. When gas prices are high, more people get &#x201c;pump rage&#x201d; and try to drive off without paying for gas. The Indian and Pakistani immigrants who own and staff many stations bear the brunt. After 9/11, people who were angry at some vague combination of OPEC and Osama bin Laden attacked a hundred clerks at 7&#x2013;Eleven gas stations and convenience stores in a month. Five men were killed for looking &#x201c;Middle Eastern.&#x201d; A photo of bin Laden in a 7&#x2013;Eleven uniform circulated on the Internet. The National Association of Convenience Stores issued a list of tips to discourage customers from attacking employees&#x2014;including posting flags near the cash register.<br><br>In this harsh microclimate, B. J. maintains an impartial vigilance. When a woman enters and asks to use the phone, he activates the indifferent stupor, gesturing vaguely in the direction of a pay phone.<br><br>In a less charitable person, working in a gas station would have long ago brought on moral exhaustion and cynicism, but B. J. has created a worldview that embraces the station. &#x201c;Everything is in the gas station,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Good people and bad people are here. Not many honest people.&#x201d; Spending mornings with B. J. gives me time to reconsider the extreme disinterest I&#x2019;ve noticed in convenience store clerks over the years. B. J. is clearly operating the selective stupor on a very high level&#x2014;perhaps as a watchful hibernation, or a trancelike sensitivity to the station&#x2019;s periphery. Anyway, he has perfected the art of being aware of the bad people going round without letting on that he&#x2019;s awake.<br><br>A man comes in carrying a tiny dog and asking for M&amp;M&#x2019;s; B. J. gives him a big grin.<br><br>A woman asks for the restroom. B. J. waves noncommitally at the sign, &#x201c;No Restroom,&#x201d; and the woman pixillates back into the fog. When a gnarled old man with a froth of white hair and huge yellow shooting glasses hands him a $10 bill, B. J. says gently, &#x201c;Hello, my friend, how are you?&#x201d;<br><br>However harsh the gas station microclimate is, it&#x2019;s also a neighborhood for anyone who wants one. One industry focus group was surprised to find that customers had &#x201c;deep feelings&#x201d; for clerks. &#x201c;Convenience store clerks are at the bottom of the retail ladder,&#x201d; says Jay Gordon of industry publication <i>C&#x2013;Store Decisions</i>, &#x201c;but that&#x2019;s not how people perceive them. One woman described her local clerk as a &#x201c;superhero, with six arms, always giving directions, napkins, and keeping things moving. Superhuman.&#x201d;<br><br>One morning B. J. talks about how he left his family&#x2019;s farm in India in 1984. His family feared he&#x2019;d be persecuted because he was Sikh, and the family&#x2019;s oldest son, so he left the country. He went first to Singapore, then Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and finally New Jersey, where he worked in a relative&#x2019;s gas station. His English is haphazard. &#x201c;New Jersey. My skin no like cold. Look ugly. My ears turn black.&#x201d; He grins at his ghoulishness. &#x201c;I pack up me money and I come here.&#x201d; California. His family has joined him here. His daughter is a nurse, his son an X&#x2013;ray technician, and his son&#x2013;in&#x2013;law an engineer who&#x2019;s getting his MBA. Back in India, his younger brother runs the farm. B. J. has a theory about gas stations and life in general: &#x201c;If I am good all is good. If I am bad all people look bad. I am nice and I have nice kids. If I am bad they will steal...&#x201d; He explains this to me a few times until it takes on the attributes of a philosophy.<br><br>The customers keep coming. They buy energy drinks and power bars and candy and Visine: Everyone spends time in front of the coolers, which are called &#x201c;the vault.&#x201d; The name properly recognizes both their position in the store&#x2014;always opposite the door&#x2014;and their role in bringing in a high percentage of the store&#x2019;s profits.<br><br>Snapple is advertising a drink involving bananas. The decal on the cooler says &#x201c;Release Your Inner Chimp.&#x201d; I look at the stream of distracted people coming into the store and wonder how many of them are attracted by the faux naughtiness implied by &#x201c;Corn Gone Wrong&#x201d; and &#x201c;Release Your Inner Chimp.&#x201d; Why is it that the coolly rational customers who shop ruthlessly for the cheapest gas turn into formless emotional mush&#x2014;susceptible to the likes of their &#x201c;inner chimp&#x201d;&#x2014;when they enter the convenience store?<br>&#x201c;<b>I make more money</b> selling water than gas,&#x201d; says owner Michael Gharib. &#x201c;And the gas gets shipped around the world and goes through a refinery and still my customers want it cheap.&#x201d; Wearing a pressed pinkstriped Ralph Lauren shirt, Gharib arrives at the station ready to spread his sense of order, compulsively arranging the mints as he talks about the twenty years he&#x2019;s owned the place. When he started he made his money selling gas with a profit margin of 10 cents a gallon, but as gas margins have fallen, he uses the store&#x2019;s 25 percent margin to boost the overall business. He moves on to dust the Daffy Duck Pez dispensers, straightens the STP carb cleaner, and leaves the dusty Fritos in a cup alone on the bottom shelf. Onward to the Skittles! Gharib has the shoulders of a weight lifter, and big, liquid brown eyes. When he&#x2019;s in the store it seems suddenly smaller, its two hundred products ajumble until he personally straightens them. As I watch him, it dawns on me that the thing I&#x2019;ve thought of as a gas station for the past twenty years is actually more of a Skittles emporium that sells gasoline.<br><br>The candy wizards, for example, contain about 50 cents profit. To make that 50 cents selling gasoline, the store would have to sell 10 gallons of gas. (And presumably the wizards are not combustible.) Nationally, sunglasses have a 100 percent markup, ice is 60 percent, candy is 43, and cigarettes are 19. Gasoline&#x2019;s profitability has been falling over the past few years, reaching just 7 percent in 2004, the lowest in twenty years. It seems that the more ruthlessly we shop for the cheapest gasoline, the more vulnerable we are to the likes of Corn Gone Wrong: Impulse buys make up three-quarters of the $132 billion spent in convenience stores. The gigantic economy of oil marketing comes to one ironic point: Selling gasoline in America requires the assistance of candy wizar...</p><h2>High, Wide, and Frightened</h2><p><p>Louise Thaden wrote <i>High, Wide, and Frightened</i> in the prime of her life, making this autobiography unique among books about the Golden Age of Aviation. Thaden, a contemporary of pioneering women pilots Amelia Earhart, Ruth Elder, Florence Klingensmith, and Ruth Nichols, was part of a small group of determined women who overcame discrimination and obstacles to become pilots in a time when air races and distance, altitude and endurance records were daily news in America. She became the first woman to win the Bendix Transcontinental Air Race, the premier air race of the day and, before her, a male-dominated one.</p><p><i>High, Wide, and Frightened</i> is the story of Thaden&#x2019;s life, of her achievements in aviation, and also of her childhood in Arkansas. She writes about her everyday personal life and her day-today experiences in aviation.</p></p><p>Born in 1905 and raised in Arkansas, Louise Thaden attended the University of Arkansas from 1921 to 1925 before moving to California, where she earned her pilot&#x2019;s certificate in 1927. Within the year, she had broken the women&#x2019;s world record for altitude and endurance. In 1929 she won the first Women&#x2019;s Air Derby, a transcontinental race. Over the next several years, Thaden continued to set records and win awards until 1938 when she retired to spend more time with her family and write these memoirs.&#x201c;Although other women pilots of her era&#x2015;like Amelia Earhart and Jacqueline Cochran&#x2015;are better known, it was Louise who, in her own quiet way, was blazing a trail for others to follow. I can think of no finer example for young women today than Louise.&#x201d; &#x2015;Claudia Oakes, former curator, Aeronautics Department, National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution and author of United States Women in Aviation Before World War I and United States Women in Aviation 1930&#x2013;1939<br><br>&#x201c;Adventure, history, danger, intrigue, death. Tom Clancy? No, Louise Thaden, and it&#x2019;s all true. The unassuming contemporary of Amelia Earhart describes the dangers of racing and setting records in the fragile and precarious aircraft of aviation&#x2019;s youth. Flashy bravado is out. Quiet excellence is in. This is a must-read.&#x201d; &#x2015;Gene Nora Jessen, author of The Powder Puff Derby of 1929: The First All-Women&#x2019;s Transcontinental Air Race<br><br>&#x201c;The Golden Era of Aviation was a time of great adventure and personal sacrifice for flyers&#x2015;particularly women flyers. Louise Thaden was, by far, the most skilled and accomplished aviatrix of that era. In her book, High, Wide, and Frightened, Louise gives us a firsthand account of the life that she and other women pilots pursued in their quest for the thrill and romance of flight.&#x201d; &#x2015;Capt. Susan Dusenbury, Airborne Express</p><h2>The Mount Shasta Mission</h2><p><p>In <i>Dancing in the Shadows of the Moon</i>, Machaelle wrote that what happened on Mt. Shasta in 1985 was "a book in itself." Well, here's the book!</p> <p><i>The Mount Shasta Mission</i> is a story that starts slowly and quietly. Unbeknownst to Machaelle at that time, pieces that were seemingly unconnected but were later critical to the Mission were being put into place. This is where we see the importance of doing what we are supposed to do, even if we don't have a clue about the larger implications. By the time the Naked Man arrives on the scene (yes, there's a naked man in the book) and a commitment to the Mission is made, the story picks up speed and takes on the force of a high-speed train. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be amazed, you'll want to scream, you'll probably even want to slug a few people--but mostly, you'll gain a new appreciation of life and all that is happening around us. And you'll know in new ways just how much we are not alone when we humans are faced with the sometimes daunting task of moving ourselves and our world forward.</p> <p>This book is not for you if: </p><li>You don't like detail and prefer to read "A miracle occurs here and they all lived happily ever after."<br> </li><li>The Big Picture scares you.<br> </li><li>You believe thinking about government and its impact on the social structure around you is beneath you.<br> </li><li>You like being uninformed.<br> </li><li>You don't wish to live within your community (immediate and global) more responsibly.<br> </li><li>You don't want to know how a multi-level project such as the Mt.

Despite aligning with Lucifer and the rebel angels, Georgia--an angel of Seraphic status--was permitted to remain on Earth and continue her role as a Watcher. In this book, Georgia, writing together with Timothy Wyllie, shares her personal account of half a million years on this planet. <br> <br>Focusing this volume 38,000 years after the angelic rebellion, Georgia shares her experiences being present for key decisions taken by the rebel angel leadership, witnessing firsthand Earth&#x2019;s steady descent into darkness, ignorance, and confusion. Georgia explores mythic events in Earth&#x2019;s ancient history, such as visits from the Nephilim and the Pleiadians and the destruction of Lemuria, and reveals information about angelic influence, their ability to affect whales and dolphins, and the presence of illicit alien colonies in remote areas of Earth. Interweaving her own story with observations about Timothy Wyllie&#x2019;s current and previous lives, such as his long involvement with the Process Church, she explores the supreme significance of the Earth as a world on which the rebel angels have been accorded the privilege of mortal incarnation and as an arena for accelerating spiritual growth. <br> <br>Georgia shares her words, in part, to awaken some of the over 100 million rebel angels currently living out their human lives, most unaware of their angelic heritage and struggling with their sense of being so different from other people. She shows that a mortal incarnation for a rebel angel is an opportunity to personally redeem their past and help prepare the way for the imminent transformation of global consciousness as the Earth is welcomed back into the Multiverse.</p><p>Trained as an architect, Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was a graphic artist and writer who, after a near-death experience in 1973, specialized in the study of non-human intelligences, such as angels, ETs, and dolphins. He was the author of several books, including <i>The Return of the Rebel Angels</i> and <i>Awakening of the Watchers</i>.Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was born in Great Britain and raised in London. Having wended his way through an English public school education and then seven years further study at college, he qualified as an architect. In the late 70s, Timothy began a systematic exploration of out-of-body states. This led to experiments in telepathic communication with dolphins and an open invitation to contact with nonphysical beings that continues to this day. During this time, he was also running his own business in New York City, marketing a system he had co-devised for storing and filing color photographs. He retired from the business community in 1981 and turned full time to his creative endeavors. As a musician, Timothy made several tapes of what he called "Bozon Music"--a True Age improvisational jazz, shamanic music of the heart--as well as a series of guided visualization and meditation tapes. Also an artist, he worked on a virtually endless progression of drawings of sacred landscape. It was what brought him most joy. Timothy traveled frequently to give lectures and seminars or to investigate sites and locations for his drawings. He is the author of <i>Ask Your Angels: A Practical Guide to Working with the Messengers of Heaven to Empower and Enrich Your Life</i>, <i>Dolphins, ETs &amp; Angels</i>, the Rebel Angels series of books featured below, and a co-author of <i>Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angels, Aliens, Dolphins &amp; Shamans</i>.</p><h2>India&#39;s Struggle for Independence</h2><p><i>India's Struggle For Independence presents a detailed outlook on the struggle for Indian Independence in a new analytical framework.</i><br><br>Designed for ardent history enthusiasts, <i>India's Struggle For Independence</i> is one of the most exhaustive and precise account of the struggle of Indian Independence ever written in the literary world.

Many food allergies inefficiently and overabundantly stimulate the immune system to react and cause inflammatory responses. Any inflammation in the body interferes with and slows down metabolism and the healing response. Chronic inflammation within our bodies erodes our wellness and paves the path for ill health.<br><br>Today's research clearly shows that our health is very dependent on the food we eat. Poor nutrition choices and hidden food allergies can cause inflammation in the body, which can lead to serious, chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer and stroke, the three leading causes of death in the United States. Inflammation is also linked to arthritis, diabetes, asthma, and allergies.<br><br>Dr. Black wrote <i>The Anti-Inflammation Diet &amp; Recipe Book</i> in 2006, the first book to give the complete anti-inflammation program with specifics on how to eat and cook in order to prevent and counter inflammation, because many of her patients wanted to follow a naturopathic, anti-inflammatory diet but couldn't find any recipes to use.<br><br>The anti-inflammatory diet eliminates many common allergenic foods that may promote inflammation in the body and reduces intake of pesticides, hormones, and antibiotic residues. The diet is full of whole foods, eliminates processed foods, sugars, and other man-made foods such as hydrogenated oils, and encourages ample vegetable intake for essential nutrients. The anti-inflammatory diet therefore promotes simpler and easier digestion and offers less insult on the body by reducing intake of toxins and other difficult to digest foods. If the blood and lymph are properly supplied and difficult to digest or assimilate foods are eliminated, cellular function, or in other words, metabolism, improves. Therefore the body is supported in such a way as to facilitate cellular regeneration and not cellular degeneration, which may promote disease.<br><br>After the success of her first book, Dr. Black follows up with even more information, recipes, and tips to minimize or prevent inflammation by changing your diet. As stress and emotional issues are connected to inflammation, she encourages people to adopt an Anti-Inflammatory Lifestyle (AIL) that includes exercise and lifestyle suggestions. The first part of the book uses the latest research to explain the benefits of the anti-inflammatory diet, detailing the science behind the recipes. Then, she reveals the basics of cooking to reduce inflammation. She gives the low-down on using different kinds of oil, sweeteners, and substitutions, and she includes a resource list on where to get certain foods, a grocery list of food you should have in your kitchen, and charts of foods to eat chart and foods to avoid. (Leading up to publication these charts and perhaps a daily recipe will be available as downloads, after publication they will be part of a smart phone app).<br><br>The second half of the book contains 150 recipes, many of which can be used as templates for even greater meals. Dr. Black and her two daughters prepared and tested all the recipes, using organic and nutrient-rich foods, eliminating common allergenic foods, and reducing the intake of pesticides and hormones--all of which help to build stronger, healthier, healing bodies. The author offers substitution suggestions and includes a full nutrition analysis with each of the recipes. Icons identify recipes that are responsive to dietary restrictions, i.e., vegan, gluten-free, dairy free, etc.<br><br>Whether you're ready for breakfast or dessert, Dr. Black has a delicious recipe for you to use and share with your family and friends so that you can live healthy, inflammation-free lifestyles.</p><p><b>Dr. Jessica Black</b> graduated from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine where she obtained her medical training.

With no rational explanation for her out-of-body experience (OBE) she turned to astral projection and the paranormal, but soon despaired of finding answers. Decades later, a Swiss neurosurgeon accidentally discovered the spot in the brain that can induce OBEs and everything changed; this crucial spot is part of the brain's self-system and when disturbed so is our experience of self. Blackmore leaped back into OBE research and at last began to unravel what had happened to her. <i>Seeing Myself</i> describes her long quest for answers through spirituality, religion, drugs, meditation, philosophy and neuroscience.</p><p>Anyone can have an OBE, indeed 15 per cent of us have. Even more have experienced sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming and the creepy sense of an invisible presence. At last, with the advent of brain stimulation, fMRI scanning and virtual reality, all these phenomena are beginning to make sense. Long relegated to the very fringes of research, the new science of out-of-body experiences is now contributing to our understanding of consciousness and our very selves.</p></p><p><b>Susan J. Blackmore </b>is a distinguished and influential psychologist, known for her books exploring consciousness, memetics, evolution and spirituality.

Named for its two "numberings," or censuses, of Israel&#x2015;the generation that left Egypt and the generation that entered the land of promise&#x2015;Numbers frames a fascinating account of the pilgrim people Israel learning to trust God. Readers are frequently puzzled by the dazzling variety of literature that makes up this book and wonder how to make sense of the whole. But in this thorough exposition of Numbers, Raymond Brown discloses the careful design and message of Numbers. He shows how God provides for the basic needs of the ideal life: to be loved, to be free, to be certain. Further, Brown highlights the rich theological themes of Numbers, untangles its meaning for today's readers and shows its enduring relevance for God's people.</p><p>Raymond Brown was formerly principal of Spurgeon's College in London, England, and he has also served in several pastorates.

Kathleen Levine, a longtime resident of Gloucester, Massachusetts, is maternal and steady, a devoted children's librarian, a convert to Judaism, and mother to two grown sons. When her serene life is thrown into turmoil by a diagnosis of breast cancer at fifty-nine, painful past secrets emerge and she desperately needs a friend. Forty-two-year-old Joyce Tabachnik is a sharp-witted freelance writer who is also at a fragile point in her life. She's come to Gloucester to follow her literary aspirations, but realizes that her husband and young daughter are becoming increasingly distant. Together, Kathleen and Joyce forge a once-in-a-lifetime bond and help each other to confront scars left by old emotional wounds.</p><p>Given the breadth of Anita Diamant's bestselling biblical epic, <i>The Red Tent</i>, it seems natural that her second novel has a much closer focus. Set in the small Massachusetts fishing town of Gloucester, <i>Good Harbor</i> is a slow-paced study of female friendship. Here Diamant can luxuriate in the development of just two principal characters: 59-year-old Kathleen Levine, a children's librarian who is undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer, and a 42-year-old romance novelist, Joyce Tabachnik, who has bought a summer retreat in Gloucester in the hope of finally writing a "serious" book. The two meet at temple after a service presided over by a newly hired female rabbi. (What joy it must have been for Diamant, who chronicled so much oppression of Hebrew women in <i>The Red Tent</i>, to casually include the presence of female clergy.) Kathleen has no real confidante aside from her husband, Buddy; Joyce is facing estrangement from both her business-minded husband, Frank, and her soccer-obsessed daughter, Nina. What the women are lacking, they find in each other. As their intimacy grows, Diamant sometimes tells us what we already know, breaking into a conversation, for example, to announce how well things are going ("They smiled at each other. They were going to be okay."). This is a moving story nonetheless--short on incident, but with carefully drawn characters and fluid, matter-of-fact prose. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Anita Diamant is the bestselling author of the novels <i>The Boston Girl</i>, <i>The Red Tent, Good Harbor,</i> <i>The Last Days of Dogtown</i>, and <i>Day After Night</i>, and the collection of essays, <i>Pitching My Tent.</i> An award-winning journalist whose work appeared in <i>The Boston Globe Magazine</i> and <i>Parenting,</i> she is the author of six nonfiction guides to contemporary Jewish life.

Morton and Chuck Death deliver an irreverent, heartfelt, and devastatingly funny history of rock and roll. Like Monty Python at its best, their version is surreal and ridiculous - yet somehow everything in it rings true. According to Morton and Death, the bass player in Led Zeppelin was Jean-Paul Sartre. And despite having been able to think up brilliant titles for their first three albums, Led Zeppelin were stuck for what to call the fourth one - so they put a load of prunes on the front. In strip after strip, Morton &amp; Death pinpoint the absurdities and oddities of rock history. In the process, they often come closer to its truth than conventional accounts do, as well as being far more entertaining. As for the drawings, their caricatures of rock stars from Mick Jagger to Frank Zappa, Johnny Rotten to Courtney Love, are in themselves worth the price of admission.</p><p>Chuck Death is the nom de guerre of musician/artist Jon Langford.

In London with his wife and children for the duration of the war, he mysteriously disappears and the rest of the family relocates to a small town in Ohio. Here Joseph Skizzen grows up and leads a resolutely ordinary life, but one that is built on a scaffold of forgery and deceit. Outwardly he is a professor of music at a mediocre college; secretly he is the earnestly obsessive curator of a private Inhumanity Museum, meant to contain the guilt of centuries of atrocities. <i>Middle C</i> tells the story of his journey&#x2014;a story that is also an investigation into the nature of identity and the ways in which each of us is several selves.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>William H. Gass&#x2014;essayist, novelist, literary critic&#x2014;was born in Fargo, North Dakota. He is the author of seven works of fiction and nine books of essays, including&nbsp;<i>Life Sentences, A Temple of Texts,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Tests of Time,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;was a professor of philosophy at Washington University. He died in 2017.&nbsp;</p><i>. . . it repented Jehovah that he had made man . . .</i><br><br>Chapter 1<br><br> Miriam, whom Joey Skizzen thought of as his mother, Nita, began to speak about the family&#x2019;s past, but only after she decided that her husband was safely in his grave. His frowns could silence her in midsentence; even his smiles were curved in condescension, though at this time in his absence, her beloved husband&#x2019;s virtues, once admitted to be many, were written in lemon juice. He had a glare to bubble paint, she said. Her recollection of that look caused hesitations still. She would appear alarmed, wave as if she saw something gnatting near her face, and stutter to a stop. Joey was helped to remember how, at suppertime, for only then was the family gathered as a group, the spoon would become still in his father&#x2019;s soup, his father&#x2019;s head would rise to face the direction of the offending remark, his normally placid look would stiffen, and fires light in his eyes. His stare seemed unwilling to cease, although it probably was never held beyond the lifetime of a minute. But a minute . . . a minute is so long. Certainly it continued until his daughter&#x2019;s or his wife&#x2019;s uneasy expression sank into the bottom of her bowl, and the guilty head was bowed in an attitude of apology and submission.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the soup was a clear broth, as it often impecuniously was, Joey could occasionally see his face floating in a brown dream, and he thought of his mother&#x2019;s real self submerged in a brown dream too, beyond the reach of life. His father sent his spoon to the bottom, and they could hear it scrape as he ladled, faster and faster as the level dropped. He was a noisy eater because he felt noise signified relish and appreciation. Whenever a meal was especially skimpy, Yankel, as he insisted he was, slurped his soup, he sucked his teeth, and he exclaimed Aaah! after a set of swallows. When they had bread, he would strenuously rend it just above the surface of the soup so that flecks of crust would fall as snow might on a pond. Then he&#x2019;d allow the torn piece to follow after, his hands aiming it somewhat like a bomb. His father would watch the hunk slowly tan, gradually sog, and finally sink. Joseph knew he had to finish his bowl, whose basin would have to seem licked, but he hated to put his own implement down there in the dream and see it thrust through his own moist eye or quivery cheek because down there his thin bit of all-purpose tableware suddenly became his father&#x2019;s wide one, ready to scoop up his nose or chin and inhale him spoon by spoon the way, later, he read that the Titan who was called Saturn had swallowed his children.<br> &nbsp;<br> They had reached London by then, where Joseph was born Yussel, and where his father finally got a job printing leaflets for the army; leaflets that were to be dropped on the Germans to threaten or cajole. Yankel was proud of the errors he had caught in the texts. He laughed the way stout Austrians would laugh at anything inauthentic. He often described the leaflets for the family, demonstrating the size of the sheets, summarizing their messages, enacting the way they would flutter out of the sky. Heads will turn and hearts will fail, he said, spinning like a waltzer. Each littering page is hastening your father back from exile&#x2014;thanks to the RAF and the government&#x2019;s printing offices&#x2014;back to Vienna, perhaps even to Graz. His wide hands wavered for each leaf&#x2014;a wiggle here, a wobble there&#x2014;and then he would bend down to show, on the floor, how they&#x2019;d land and even how they&#x2019;d blow about the street. Already a bit of me is back, he bragged. They will pick up each piece. You know how neat we are. For the mayor he made a face that was puffed as a frog&#x2019;s; for the mayor he mimed a body bent to hold its belly from the ground; and, for the mayor, he pretended to read a quivering sheet in a quaking voice: Citizens of Graz . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> The Fixels endured the Blitz as so many others did, huddled in cellars, but Joseph could bring back from those damage-filled days nothing specific now, only a nighttime world of noise and fear and fire. As well as the warmth of friendly arms. His sister, older by two years, also remembered with fondness hours of being held by one parent or other, though they both preferred their mother, who cradled them while gently rocking her arms, whereas their father squeezed them as if, any minute, they might break free and run away, when it was the squeeze that inclined them to scoot. The dents in their skins, they both vividly recalled, were made by his metal coat buttons.<br> &nbsp;<br> A long way from Graz, his father would mutter many times a day. A long way. His head was close-cropped, already gray, his clothes simple to the point of penury. They made their lodging more in a pile of rubble than in a building, for one wall of the tenement was down, some stairs had collapsed, and many windows were broken. There is nothing here the Germans would want to bomb, Miriam remembered he often said when they sat at their single table in the middle of a ruined room to dine on dreams and reassurance. For their meals they set fires like tramps, and the shell of many a house in their sector was consumed by soup being warmed long before the incendiaries could get back to bomb them again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yankel, as he was officially known then, felt he had to keep the family&#x2019;s spirits up, especially those of Joseph&#x2019;s sister, who was inclined to mope and who simply refused to call or even think of herself as Dvorah, the name Yankel had picked out to harmonize with his; so, to do so, to keep their courage, he would uncase his cheap pinewood fiddle (as Miriam reminded Joseph, when they were both in a story mood) and scrape through a few jolly reminiscent peasant tunes. Ach, he was so bad he couldn&#x2019;t play gypsy, was the line she repeated when, in her tale, the fiddle&#x2019;s moment came. But she never referred to the instrument as a pinewood box while they were Jews because, as a Jew, Yankel was the head of the household the way, he felt, as a Jew, he ought to be: as completely in charge as any Austrian husband, but with the full backing, now, of Jehovah. All that Austrians have, he said sadly, shaking his head, <br> all that Austrians have got is God; the Jews have Yahweh. Well, which is it, Jehovah or Yahweh, Miriam asked him once. Jews are not permitted to pronounce his name, Yankel said, so they are constantly changing it. I thought they had just one God, like most people, Miriam said, in receipt of a glower. Ha! just like you used to have when you were a Catholic, her husband replied angrily. Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Mother Mary, the Four Evangelists, Gabriel and an army of angels, perhaps the pope, all the saints, more than the mind can count. Miriam stuck to her guns: One God ought to be one God, no more, no less. Even busy as he was. With a reach wide enough to attend his chores. Worship Allah, then . . . Allah is one God, Yankel would answer, triumph in his voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Miriam was accustomed to domineering men&#x2014;fathers, judges, generals, businessmen, bosses, all behind one beard, one fog of smoke, one vested chest. But the Rudi who had courted her was deferential, shy, calm, musical, not the stern bullyragging majordomo Yankel had become because he thought patriarchy was essentially Jewish. That&#x2019;s where his glare came from: the stage. Yet it seemed more genuine than the slow smile whose lips she&#x2019;d first kissed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rudi Skizzen had barely reached manhood when he met Nita Rouse at a country wedding he had been hired to fiddle for. Rudi had ridden his bicycle when he could and pushed it uphill when he had to, traveling out from Graz on narrow grass-grown roads notable for the heads of rocks that poked through everywhere, so that he dared see no scenery but the ground. At eighteen he was a better fiddler than he was at twenty-eight, and Nita, herself fourteen, with great round black eyes not like raisins, rather like plump grapes in her round face, kept her wide eyes on him while he played, and the company tried to dance the country dances, although they had already forgotten the steps they had been taught as children. The old ways were wearing thin, Miriam said, and no longer kept anybody warm. But the new ways were worse, and hell was their deserving.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nita&#x2019;s courtship, when the time came for it, was carried on in the country, too. The couple went for long walks on those same green lanes Rudi had earlier cycled over, hoping to achieve some solitude for themselves and their chaste embraces. Rudi remembered birdsong, because he had an ear for music and for poetry, while Nita saw flowers she knew well enough to name, and she frequently stooped to inspect those that forced their stems up between the many rocks to bloom yellow, blue, and white like bursts of pleasure, but she was careful to stoop without letting go of Rudi&#x2019;s hand, an attention that made her dawdling delightful for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> I always knew we&#x2019;d have a plain and simple way of getting on, Miriam said, for we were not privileged people, though we were not spared their worries. I was Nita then and could play cards and joke with men. I did hope to have a country life, away from hard roads, noise, and rancor, but Rudi wanted to be where he could use his music, and I thought him a fine fiddle player then, before I&#x2019;d heard otherwise, and before his fingers grew foreign to the bow. The truth is no one could have squeezed a sweet tune from that soft cheap flimsy wood of his. What if he had had a decent violin? Maybe the opera in Vienna would have heard him, or in a caf� a gypsy&#x2014;to his strains&#x2014;whirl her skirts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nita&#x2019;s new husband found for his family a small leaky roof in Graz, and the printer&#x2019;s trade, learned from Rudi&#x2019;s father, put a modest living on their skimpy table; but Rudi Skizzen&#x2019;s talent lay nowhere near the typesetter&#x2019;s trays or music&#x2019;s page; he had two great gifts: first, he was a seer; he saw the future as if he were reading it on one of his broadsides; and second, he was born for the stage; he had as many colors as the chameleon; he filled roles like a baker; indeed, it was a Yankel he one day became, moving his family to an outskirt of Vienna and turning all of them but Joseph, who had not yet been born, into Jews simply by pinning a yarmulke to his hair with a bent wire and informing anyone interested that his name was Yankel Fixel. His wife heard this news without hearing. Was their name henceforth to be Fixel? Their name and the name of the boy who would be born, no longer under Bethlehem&#x2019;s star, was Fixel? Yussel Fixel? A clown&#x2019;s cap, Miriam thought. When the baby came he was circumcised, though the bris was as imaginary as the rest of life, and performed&#x2014;who knew?&#x2014;on the wrong day. Moreover, the mother of the recently brutalized child was now named Miriam. To her surprise. To her confounding.<br> &nbsp;<br> The family didn&#x2019;t look very Jewish, but who, Yankel argued, would admit they were Jewish if they weren&#x2019;t Jewish? and why would they say they were Jewish in such uncomfortable times for Jews, when anyone who was Jewish and had any sense would put on Catholic habits in a thrice if they could get away with it, or twirl like a dervish, or leap like any Leaping Lena, if it would do the trick. Yet, as though Rudi had waved a wand and cried presto-changeo to impress a crowd, mass was now modified until it reached kosher. Although what was kosher confused Yankel. Jews were forbidden to see milk and meat on the same plate let alone seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk or drink and chew simultaneously. Jews were often thought to be otherwise than everybody, but who would want to mix milk and meat that intimately anyway? even bites of the same stew had to succeed one another. But by six hours? so they wouldn&#x2019;t have an intestinal confrontation? Well, he couldn&#x2019;t afford two pots for each person, two bowls, two dishes, two spoons. And every animal was unclean except those that resembled Satan&#x2014;he of the cloven hoof&#x2014;or those who looked silly, chewing their cud. And threw up. This was confusing. Fish without scales and fins were forbidden? who had ever heard of any? Did they mean whales? In addition, the Jews had special killers for their cows. Never mind, he was too poor to have much meat or too worried to practice rites in public and thereby advertise mistakes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nita claimed Rudi was especially comfortable in his role as Yankel when it came to the Jewish abhorrence of blood. They drained and buried the blood of the animals they killed, and they didn&#x2019;t hunt. His hatred of hunting, which his son shared, was certainly not Austrian. They were peace-loving, he thought, the Jews. All to the good. But why did they have it in for shrimp, lobster, mussels, clams? Being a Jew would be confusing; it would mean sacrifice; yet Yankel felt there was no time to lose, so the changeo must be presto, whatever the risk. Yankel Fixel had learned that there was a small underground organization smuggling Jews out of Austria to England. England was where he was bound, but he had no money in the pocket and person of Rudi Skizzen for the passage, so Yankel Fixel, a case for charity&#x2019;s mercies, he became.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Rudi Skizzen not Yankel Fixel who had the accomplished nose, and who could sense rot reaching a hazardous level. Rudi was not vastly lettered, but like most Austrians, he knew of Karl Kraus and of Karl Kraus&#x2019;s unpopular pacifist opinions. He had few beliefs he cherished, but one was that wars were always started by the powerful to be fought by the powerless who numerously suffered and died in them, though they were never better off whatever the outcome. He knew that of all the creatures God had put into this world, humans were the untrustworthiest and the meanest, another sentiment his son would share. In Eden, no snake had been needed. The Fall could be performed a cappella. He remembered how Karl Kraus admired dogs because a dog could smell shit a long way, though it be hidden in leather trousers, though it be squeezed from beauteous buttocks; but maybe it was not yet shit the dog smelled, but piss left in the pants, or a little blood released by a puncture, or pus from a wound long in service. Anyway, Rudi Skizzen smelled it&#x2014;in the hunter-green coats, the embroidered blouses, the lederhosen, in the discreet farts from comfortable bellies, in the social rudeness of the properly positioned, and, above all, in good times: in the mug and on the platter, in raucous communal song, immersed in the smell of kraut, sausages, and beer. Austrians, he said, were both coarse and cultivated, and on the road between them was a stop called cruel. Cruelty came easy to engines of mastication, to people who didn&#x2019;t keep the door closed between milk and meat.</p><h2>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</h2><p><p>This audiobook provides fascinating insights into the hedge fund traders who consistently outperform the markets, in their own words.</p><p></p><p>From bestselling author, investment expert, and Wall Street theoretician Jack Schwager comes a behind-the-scenes look at the world of hedge funds, from 15 traders who've consistently beaten the markets.

The book will have strong appeal to three main audiences; those managing capital professionally, those evaluating professional money managers, and those readers who want to manage their own money more effectively.<br><br> The fact that markets and the money management industry have gone through tumultuous change makes the central message of the book all the more powerful...that the key ingredients to successful performance are timeless and true in radically different environments. Those ingredients, an appreciation for the balance of risk versus reward in a trade, discipline, adaptability, an open mind, and intellectual honesty that enables one to learn from mistakes, come to life in Schwager's riveting interviews with a number of managers.<br><br> The characters' stories highlight their very different personalities and lifestyles and are interesting in and of themselves. But it is Schwager's unique ability to illustrate their winning strategies and interweave their personal backgrounds and emotional highs and lows that makes <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i> both a highly entertaining read and learning experience. What most jumps out at the reader is how radically different styles and approaches all share the common traits mentioned above. By exemplifying these traits in a number of managers with seemingly different investment philosophies, whether it be short term vs. long term trading, large capital or small, or technical vs. fundamental analysis, Schwager is able to better highlight their essential importance to successful investing. By highlighting their differences, the common thread of their similarities is much more evident. Schwager reinforces the message with succinct summaries of what these commonalities are throughout the book.<br><br> Whether a reader is a professional money manager or simply managing their own capital, I have no doubt they will find <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i> both entertains and enhances their ability to grow their capital.<br> <i>Stanley Druckenmiller founded Duquesne Capital Management, which compounded at 30% per annum without a single losing year from its inception in 1981 to its closing in 2010.

The last chapter distills the wisdom of the 15 skilled traders interviewed into 40 key market lessons. A sampling is provided below:<br><br> <b>1. There Is No Holy Grail in Trading</b><br> Many traders mistakenly believe that there is some single solution to defining market behavior. Not only is there no single solution to the markets, but those solutions that do exist are continually changing. The range of the methods used by the traders interviewed in Hedge Fund Market Wizards, some of which are even polar opposites, is a testament to the diversity of possible approaches. There are a multitude of ways to be successful in the markets, albeit they are all hard to find and achieve.<br><br> <b>2. Don't Confuse the Concepts of Winning and Losing Trades with Good and Bad Trades</b><br> A good trade can lose money, and a bad trade can make money. Even the best trading processes will lose a certain percentage of the time. There is no way of knowing a priori which individual trade will make money. As long as a trade adhered to a process with a positive edge, it is a good trade, regardless of whether it wins or loses because if similar trades are repeated multiple times, they will come out ahead. Conversely, a trade that is taken as a gamble is a bad trade regardless of whether it wins or loses because over time such trades will lose money.<br><br> <b>3. The Road to Success Is Paved with Mistakes</b><br> Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, strongly believes that learning from mistakes is essential to improvement and ultimate success. Each mistake, if recognized and acted upon, provides an opportunity for improving a trading approach. Most traders would benefit by writing down each mistake, the implied lesson, and the intended change in the trading process. Such a trading log can be periodically reviewed for reinforcement. Trading mistakes cannot be avoided, but repeating the same mistakes can be, and doing so is often the difference between success and failure.<br><br> <b>4. The Importance of Doing Nothing</b><br> For some traders, the discipline and patience to do nothing when the environment is unfavorable or opportunities are lacking is a crucial element in their success. For example, despite making minimal use of short positions, Kevin Daly, the manager of the Five Corners fund, achieved cumulative gross returns in excess of 800% during a 12-year period when the broad equity markets were essentially flat. In part, he accomplished this feat by having the discipline to remain largely in cash during negative environments, which allowed him to sidestep large drawdowns during two major bear markets. The lesson is that if conditions are not right, or the return/risk is not sufficiently favorable, don't do anything. Beware of taking dubious trades out of impatience.<br><br> <b>5. Volatility and Risk Are Not Synonymous</b><br> Low volatility does not imply low risk and high volatility does not imply high risk. Investments subject to sporadic large risks may exhibit low volatility if a risk event is not present in the existing track record. For example, the strategy of selling out-of-the-money options can exhibit low volatility if there are no large, abrupt price moves, but is at risk of asymptotically increasing losses in the event of a sudden, steep selloff. On the other hand, traders such as Jamie Mai, the portfolio manager for Cornwall Capital, will exhibit high volatility because of occasional very large gains-not a factor that most investors would associate with risk or even consider undesirable-but will have strictly curtailed risk because of the asymmetric structure of their trades. So some strategies, such as option selling, can have both low volatility and large, open-ended risk, and some strategies, such as Mai's, can have both high volatility and constrained risk.<br><br> As a related point, investors often make the mistake of equating manager performance in a given year with manager skill. Sometimes, more skilled managers will underperform because they refuse to participate in market bubbles. The best performers during such periods are often the most imprudent rather than the most skilled managers. Martin Taylor, the portfolio manager of the Nevsky Fund, underperformed in 1999 because he thought it was ridiculous to buy tech stocks at their inflated price levels. This same investment decision, however, was instrumental to his large outperformance in subsequent years when these stocks witnessed a prolonged, massive decline. In this sense, past performance can sometimes even be an inverse indicator. <br> <br><br><p>What makes a great trader? For years, financial industry expert Jack Schwager has picked the brains of remarkable individuals who have consistently beaten the markets to find out the answer. Now, in <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards: How Winning Traders Win</i>, he talks with some of the world's greatest hedge fund experts, highlighting the lessons to be learned from each so that you can apply their wisdom to your own trading.</p> <p>Over the past few decades, hedge funds have become an increasingly popular investment vehicle, but their explosive growth has made trading more competitive than ever. In <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i>, Schwager shares with readers the invaluable lessons he learned from the fifteen traders profiled, which include some of the industry's legendary figures, each of whom has compiled an exemplary return-to-risk record.</p> <p>From the founder of the world's largest hedge fund to a manager going it alone, the traders interviewed in this book approach their field in radically different ways. But each of them has brought new and unique insights and developed distinct strategies that have allowed them to outperform the markets again and again.</p> <p>Just as he did in his previous bestsellers, <i>Market Wizards</i> and <i>The New Market Wizards,</i> Schwager asks the questions that get to the core of what makes a successful trader tick. Distilling forty essential lessons to be learned from the market luminaries it profiles, <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i> offers valuable guidance and timeless insights for both investment professionals and market enthusiasts looking to improve their trading abilities by learning from the best.</p></p><h2>Brush of Angel&#39;s Wings (A Heaven On Earth Novel)</h2><p><p>He doesn&#x2019;t plan to stay Amish.

The old guard, shocked by the habits of the war baby youth, sets out to fight back. The battle reaches uncomfortably close to Troy. While he is on medical leave, the Yard brings charges against an acquaintance of his, a hedonistic doctor with a penchant for voyeurism and young women, two of whom just happen to be sleeping with a senior man at the Foreign Office as well as a KGB agent.<br>But on the eve of the verdict a curious double case of suicide drags Troy back into active duty. Beyond bedroom acrobatics, the secret affairs now stretch to double crosses and deals in the halls of power, not to mention murder. It&#x2019;s all Troy can do to stay afloat in a country immersed in drugs, up to its neck in scandal.</p><p>John Lawton is the author of the Inspector Troy series, the Joe Wilderness series, Sweet Sunday, and Unholy Joy, a volume of history. His Inspector Troy novels have been named Best Books of the Year by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and New York Times Book Review. He lives in England.London in the swinging '60s provides the setting for this latest in Lawton's series featuring Scotland Yard lawman Frederick Troy. Troy finds himself a reluctant attendee at several country weekends where a flashy acquaintance, Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick, holds sybaritic court. The aristocratic Troy has been, equally reluctantly, attempting to acclimate himself to the wide-open atmosphere of the new England, a country in the grip of a seismic social and sexual upheaval. Fitz and several government cronies have been shagging a pair of beautiful twins, the Ffitch sisters, and the equally lovely but underage Clover Browne. When Fitz is arrested for "immoral earnings and procurement," Troy escapes the media spotlight, confined to a sanatorium with a nasty case of tuberculosis. Troy rallies to investigate after several participants in the Fitz scandal are found dead. The whodunit phase takes several hundred pages to ignite, but Lawton is such an entertaining, literate storyteller it doesn't really matter. Once the now frail Troy steps in, neither threats, beatings, near-drowning nor shooting can frighten him off the case.

Who wouldn&#x2019;t take a swap like that? Then again, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is, as Meg and Peter Kaplan soon discover. Heading south for a supposed dream vacation, what they find instead is a panic attack waiting to happen. Coconuts crash through windows, bearing cryptic death threats. People fall from palm trees while spying on the pool. Neighbors whisper of Mob connections, leaving the Kaplans to wonder if they&#x2019;ll get whacked by mistake in the Southernmost City or if their cozy West Side co-op has been transformed into a convenient Mafia morgue. Enter an FBI agent going rogue, a very good girl determined to be very bad, and the irrepressible Bert the Shirt with his chihuahua, and the cast is complete for this riotous Florida romp. Told with Laurence Shames&#x2019; trademark mix of suspense and comedy, mayhem and romance, crackling dialogue and lush description, TROPICAL SWAP is a vacation you can savor without ever leaving home.</p><p>Laurence Shames has been a New York City taxi driver, lounge singer, furniture mover, lifeguard, dishwasher, gym teacher, and shoe salesman. Having failed to distinguish himself in any of those professions, he turned to writing full-time in 1976 and has not done an honest day's work since. His basic laziness notwithstanding, Shames has published more than twenty books and hundreds of magazine articles and essays. Best known for his critically acclaimed series of Key West novels, he has also authored non-fiction and enjoyed considerable though largely secret success as a collaborator and ghostwriter. Shames has penned four New York Times bestsellers. These have appeared on four different lists, under four different names, none of them his own. This might be a record. Born in Newark, New Jersey in 1951, to chain-smoking parents of modest means but flamboyant emotions, Shames graduated summa cum laude from NYU in 1972 and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. Shortly after finishing college, he began annoying editors by sending them short stories they hated. He also wrote longer things he thought of as novels. He couldn't sell them. By 1979 he'd somehow passed himself off as a journalist and was publishing in top-shelf magazines like Playboy, Outside, Saturday Review, and Vanity Fair. In 1982, Shames was named Ethics columnist of Esquire, and also made a contributing editor to that magazine. By 1986 he was writing non-fiction books whose critical if not commercial success first established his credentials as a collaborator/ghostwriter. His 1991 national bestseller, BOSS OF BOSSES, written with two FBI agents, got him thinking about the Mafia. It also bought him a ticket out of New York and a sweet little house in Key West, where he finally got back to Plan A: writing fiction. Given his then-current preoccupations, the novels--beginning with FLORIDA STRAITS--naturally featured palm trees, high humidity, dogs in sunglasses, and blundering New York mobsters. Having had the good fortune to find a setting he loved and a wonderfully loyal readership as well, Shames wrote eight Key West novels during the 1990s, before taking a decade-long detour into screenwriting and collaborative work. In 2013, he returned to his favorite fictional turf with SHOT ON LOCATION--a suspenseful and hilarious mix of Hollywood glitz and Florida funky. TROPICAL SWAP, Shames&#x2019; tenth Key West novel, tells the riotous tale of a home exchange that sounds too good to be true, and is.</p><h2>I Am Princess X</h2><p>Best friends, big fans, a mysterious webcomic, and a long-lost girl collide in this riveting novel, perfect for fans of both Cory Doctorow and Sarah Dessen, &amp; illustrated throughout with comics.<br><br>Once upon a time, two best friends created a princess together.

It was vinyl, and cheap. The edge was starting to peel. The colors were a little faded. It was round with a black border. But within this border was the outline of a girl with shiny blue hair. She wore a pink puff-sleeved dress, a tall gold crown, and red Chucks. In her left hand, she held a purple sword shaped like a katana.May kept staring at the stupid sticker like maybe it&#39;d pop to life and tell her that none of it was ever true. Not the bridge. Not the car. Not the water. Not Libby&#39;s closed casket and her empty house, with an empty room, and an empty closet where the boxes of Princess X memorabilia used to be.Maybe none of it was true.

This comprehensive collection - the first in twenty years - celebrates six decades of bold imagination and fifteen books of poetry, the creative output of a lifetime. Arranged chronologically, these poems reveal the full breadth of Sarton's creative vision. Themes include the search for an inward order, her passions, the natural world, self-knowledge, and, in her latest poems, the trials of old age. Moving through Sarton's work, we see her at ease in both traditional forms and free verse, finding inspiration in snow over a dark sea, a cat's footfall on the stairs, an unexpected love affair.

Much of your conception as an improviser is determined by your technique. If you can&#39;t play certain types of ideas, you are simply not going to conceive of them while you are improvising. Even if you could, it wouldn&#39;t matter, since you couldn&#39;t play them anyway. This book presents serious chops-building technical studies for single note lines and chords. Plus, the examples feature a lot of harmonic content. The material is written in standard notation.</p><p>A professional guitarist since age 15, author and publisher Andrew Green has performed in a wide variety of jazz settings. Currently active in the New York jazz scene, Andrew is also an educator at &#34;Jazz In July&#34; at the University of Massachusetts and the &#34;Mile High Jazz Camp&#34; at the university of Colorado.When improvising, what your mind hears is more often than not determined by what your body can reproduce on your instrument. Much of your conception as an improviser is determined by your technique. If you can&#x2019;t play certain types of ideas, you are simply not going to conceive of them while you are improvising. Even if you could, it wouldn&#x2019;t matter, since you couldn&#x2019;t play them anyway. <p>There are many melodic structures that are physically challenging to play on the guitar. For example, anything that necessitates playing consecutive notes on adjacent strings presents logistical problems for both hands. This includes various arpeggios, triad-based lines, consecutive fourths, and large interval leaps. Since these melodic devices present such a challenge, the range of ideas in a typical guitar solo doesn&#x2019;t include them. </p><p>To expand the palette of musical ideas available to you as an improviser, you must expand your technique. The way to do this is to practice things that feature physically challenging motion. By playing lines that incorporate new and different types of melodic movement, you gain the technical ability necessary to improvise with these structures, and the sound of these melodies will gradually enter your musical consciousness. </p><p>The exercises in this book will improve your technique, increase the range of your ideas, and open up new avenues of improvisation to you. You, in turn will have the opportunity to add to the vocabulary of what is possible to play on the guitar.</p></p><h2>Blue Planet II: A New World of Hidden Depths</h2><p>Our understanding of ocean life has changed dramatically in the last decade, with new species, new behaviors, and new habitats being discovered at a rapid rate. <i>Blue Planet II</i>, which accompanies an epic 7-part series, is a ground-breaking new look at the richness and variety of underwater life across our planet.

The promise of escape draws people from all backgrounds to speculative fiction, but when people of color seek passageways into the fantastic, the doors are often barred. This problem lies not only with children&#x2019;s publishing, but also with the television and film executives tasked with adapting these stories into a visual world. When characters of color do appear, they are often marginalized or subjected to violence, reinforcing for audiences that not all lives matter. <br><br><i>The Dark Fantastic</i> is an engaging and provocative exploration of race in popular youth and young adult speculative fiction. Grounded in her experiences as YA novelist, fanfiction writer, and scholar of education, Thomas considers four black girl protagonists from some of the most popular stories of the early 21st century: Bonnie Bennett from the CW&#x2019;s <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>, Rue from Suzanne Collins&#x2019;s<i> The Hunger Games</i>, Gwen from the BBC&#x2019;s <i>Merlin</i>, and Angelina Johnson from J.K. Rowling&#x2019;s <i>Harry Potter.</i> Analyzing their narratives and audience reactions to them reveals how these characters mirror the violence against black and brown people in our own world. <br><br>In response, Thomas uncovers and builds upon a tradition of fantasy and radical imagination in Black feminism and Afrofuturism to reveal new possibilities. Through fanfiction and other modes of counter-storytelling, young people of color have reinvisioned fantastic worlds that reflect their own experiences, their own lives. As Thomas powerfully asserts, &#x201c;we dark girls deserve more, because we are more.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Ebony Elizabeth Thomas </b>is Associate Professor in the Literacy, Culture, and International Educational Division at the University of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Graduate School of Education.

When her keel was laid in 1912, kings and emperors still ruled much of the world. When she finally slipped beneath the waves in 1948, America was the undisputed global superpower. <i></i><p><i>Nevada</i> was revolutionary for her time: the first "superdreadnought"; the first U.S. warship to be oil fired; the first to have a triple-gun main turret; and, the first to have all-or-nothing armor. In World War I, she was based in Queenstown, Ireland, to provide protection for American convoys bringing troops to Europe. She survived the naval reduction treaties of the 1920s and was rebuilt in 1928 with the latest technology. The only battleship to get underway at Pearl Harbor, <i> suffered damage from Japanese bombs and torpedoes and sank in shallow water. Raised and repaired, she did convoy duty in the North Atlantic before joining the invasion fleet for D-Day and the landings in Southern France. Shifting to the Pacific, <i>Nevada</i> provided bombardment support at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The end of the war saw her outgunned and outmoded, but her contributions were not over. In 1946, she survived not one but two atomic tests, the second of which left the battleship too radioactive for scrapping. On a sunny day in 1948, <i>Nevada</i> was towed off the coast of Oahu and used for target practice. After five days of pounding by everything the Navy could throw her, <i>Nevada</i> was dispatched by a torpedo. She died a warrior's death. <i></i></i></p><p><i><i>Silver State Dreadnought</i> is the story of a remarkable ship, but it is also the story of the remarkable men who sailed in her. <i>Nevada's</i> first captain, William S. Sims, brought his unique style of leadership to America's premiere battleship and set the tone for what became known as the "Cheer Up Ship." As <i>Nevada</i> aged, the ship gained the affectionate name "The Old Maru," beloved by all who served in her.</i></p></p><p><b>Stephen M.

She is a soft-spoken storyteller, but her message is clear and strong, and with it she is expanding the narrative of the North, breaking new ground for Inuit art.</p> <p>Teevee hails from Cape Dorset, home to a multigenerational community of artists and the Kinngait Studios, the longest continually operating print studios in Canada. Her inventive images first appeared in the studios' annual collection of limited-edition prints in 2004 and have been represented every year since. Her work is rooted in respect for traditional Inuit culture and an abiding love of family, but along with artists such as Tim Pitsiulak and Annie Pootoogook, Teevee has proven unafraid of pushing artistic boundaries. In drawings alive with mischievous charm or weighted by a grittier reality, she often merges traditional Inuit art with contemporary aesthetics, revealing positive and negative changes to life in Arctic communities.</p> <p>In 2009, Teevee's illustrated children's book, <i>Alego,</i> was shortlisted for a Governor General's award. In 2017 <i>Ningiukulu Teevee: Kinngait Stories,</i> curated by the Winnipeg Art Gallery, opened at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC-the first major retrospective of Teevee's career to date. <i>Ningiukulu Teevee: Drawings and Prints from Cape Dorset</i> is the first monograph on the artist's work. Presented here are more than eighty reproductions and photographs, with critical context provided by Leslie Boyd, former director of Dorset Fine Arts, Toronto. Teevee's art has been exhibited widely and is in collections around the world, among them the Art Gallery of Ontario, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, and the National Gallery of Canada.</p></p><p>Leslie Boyd was employed by the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative for thirty-two years, living in Cape Dorset, Nunavut, and in Toronto, where she was director of the Co-op's marketing division, Dorset Fine Arts.

At first it seemed as if the ghost was on fire, but that was only a trick of the light. It was already quite dark along the cobblestone walk that crossed beneath the tower, so the light that emanated from the ghost filled the courtyard with an unearthly brilliance.<br><br>Eleven people were passing the tower in the moment that the apparition appeared. Three were professors who had seen many ghosts in Oxford, and so gave it no notice. Two more, also faculty at Magdalen, felt similarly about pirate costumes, and merely sniffed their annoyance as they passed, assuming as they did that it was some sort of student mischief. Four more were actual students, who reacted with surprise, awe, and no small amount of fear, and they scattered into corridors adjacent to the tower.<br><br>The last two people who witnessed the ghost&#x2019;s appearance were Caretakers of the <i>Imaginarium Geographica</i>, and a ghost pirate was at least as interesting as some of the other fantastic things they had seen, so they moved closer to have a better look.<br><br>John had arranged to meet his friend Charles at the base of Magdalen Tower so that they might walk together to their friend Jack&#x2019;s private rooms there at the college, and they met just as the sun was setting. It was in that moment that the apparition had appeared.<br><br>Even if they hadn&#x2019;t been Caretakers, a ghost would have been nothing to cause them alarm&#x2014;Oxford had long had a reputation of being a haven to spectres and spirits of all kinds, and as long as they didn&#x2019;t disrupt the business of the university, no one made a fuss. Even in the midst of the Second World War, it was also good for tourism.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d ever actually see this fellow,&#x201d; John whispered to Charles. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard about the Old Pirate for years but never had the pleasure of seeing him in person, uh, so to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How many other ghosts have you met here?&#x201d; asked Charles.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, none, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; John admitted, &#x201c;although I haven&#x2019;t exactly sought them out, either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, why not?&#x201d; Charles retorted as he approached the ghost, hand outstretched. &#x201c;They could prove to be really helpful to my writing, you know. Worth asking, anyroad.&#x201d;<br><br>The ghost simply stood there, hunched over, staring into the darkness as the Caretaker introduced himself. &#x201c;Well met, old fellow. My name is Charles.&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly the ghost began to move, jerking about awkwardly, as if it were a puppet in a penny nickelodeon. It seemed as if speaking to it had engaged it in some way. Charles dropped his hand. &#x201c;Are you in distress?&#x201d; he asked the ghost. &#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>The ghost stopped, then turned and focused its rheumy eyes on Charles, who took full stock of it for the first time. The spectre had presence and looked as if it stood in bright sunlight&#x2014;but it was transparent, ethereal.<br><br>By appearance, it was certainly a pirate, no doubt, but an ancient one, many, many years old. His hair was long and straggly, and the clothes he wore, once fine, were tattered with age. His hands were shaking, and his head twitched nervously. But his eyes were piercing, intense&#x2014;and, Charles thought with surprise, oddly familiar.<br><br>&#x201c;Caretakers?&#x201d; the ghost said with a trembling voice. &#x201c;Be ye Caretakers, here, at Oxford?&#x201d;<br><br>Charles and John exchanged surprised looks. This was no run-of-the-mill ghost. Not if he knew who they were. Then again, there had been stories of the Pirate Ghost appearing in this spot for two centuries, and no one had ever reported that he spoke at all, much less that he had mentioned anything about Caretakers.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is asking?&#x201d; said John, stepping forward. &#x201c;Who are you looking for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jamie?&#x201d; the ghost answered. &#x201c;Jamie, is that you?&#x201d;<br><br>John sighed. &#x201c;The only one of us who ever quit,&#x201d; he said to Charles, &#x201c;and he&#x2019;s the one everyone asks for in a crisis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the ghost said, shaking his head. &#x201c;Ye be John, I think. Ron John Tollers, unless I miss my guess.&#x201d;<br><br>John stepped back in surprise at hearing a mishmash of his nicknames. &#x201c;That&#x2014;that&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m he. Do I know you?&#x201d;<br><br>The ghost spread its arms and smiled. &#x201c;In another life, another time,&#x201d; he said, his voice weary, &#x201c;I was your friend Hank Morgan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; said John, glancing again at Charles, who was equally stunned. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t even walk across Oxford without stumbling into an adventure.&#x201d;<br><br><i>The old saying about absence making the heart grow fonder is overrated</i>, John had thought to himself as he prepared to go out earlier that afternoon. <i>Absence doesn&#x2019;t do anything except create longing, and an ache that cannot be remedied until the waiting is through.</i><br><br>He and the other Caretakers of the <i>Imaginarium Geographica</i>, Jack and Charles, had been waiting for seven years for a chance to return to the Archipelago of Dreams. In earlier times, they had gone for longer periods without visiting, but there had been less urgency in those days&#x2014;and maybe that was what stirred John&#x2019;s unease. That, or the fact that they&#x2019;d been forbidden to return. <i>We never truly know we want something</i>, he thought, <i>until we&#x2019;ve been told we can&#x2019;t have it</i>. Or perhaps it was the dark days of war covering the earth that made him long for the escape of the magical lands in the Archipelago.<br><br>Whatever it was, the price they&#x2019;d had to pay for a victory in the future was steep. They&#x2019;d jumped forward in time and defeated a terrible enemy, before returning to the time where they were meant to be. But to ensure that the victory remained certain, they had to stay away from the Archipelago, so as not to risk changing the outcome that had already happened.<br><br>They hadn&#x2019;t realized how hard it would be to wait through most of the new Great War that had swept the Summer Country.<br><br>The Darkness of the shadows was hardest to bear. In those days when the shadows of the Dragons swept over all the Earth, John in particular struggled mightily against the impulse to act.<br><br>&#x201c;We <i>are</i> acting,&#x201d; Charles and Jack would remind him, &#x201c;and we have. By waiting. We know that this is a battle we have already won, John. We just need to do our duty&#x2014;and do nothing. Nothing but wait.&#x201d;<br><br>Now, however, the waiting was almost over. The clock had caught up with the past, and the future was about to become the present again. And they could finally return and fully take up their mantle again as true Caretakers.<br><br>John had put on his jacket and looked at himself in the mirror. He was finally feeling the years of his life&#x2014;and not just because of the Wars. He had now been a Caretaker for longer than he had not. It was one of the roles that defined him&#x2014;and yet it was still one of the greatest secrets he kept from all but a few. <i>Until</i>, he thought with a smile, <i>the new calling of Jack&#x2019;s comes to fruition. If that works, well ...</i><br><br>Everything could change. Everything.<br><br>He had kissed his wife and children good-bye and stepped out the door.<br><br>It was less than an hour later that he and Charles began their conversation with the Pirate Ghost of Magdalen College.<br><br>&#x201c;Hank!&#x201d; John exclaimed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened to you? You look so ... so ...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Old?&#x201d; Morgan replied with a cackle. &#x201c;Two centuries of waiting will do that to a man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Waiting for what?&#x201d; asked Charles.<br><br>&#x201c;For you,&#x201d; the ghost replied simply. &#x201c;I was waiting for you, Good Charlie, and Ron John, and Jack-Jack the Giant Killer. I was waiting for the three of you.&#x201d; He narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;Where be Jack, anyroad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s finishing a discussion,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;We, ah, we weren&#x2019;t exactly expecting to see you, Hank.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why should ye?&#x201d; Morgan retorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only been appearing in this same spot for two hundred years, give or take.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No need to be snappish,&#x201d; said Charles, &#x201c;but you never spoke to anyone before now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because no one has ever spoken t&#x2019; me!&#x201d; said Morgan. &#x201c;It only works if <i>you</i> speak first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; John said, clearly puzzled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve lost me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No time, no time,&#x201d; said Morgan, waving his hands. Then, he laughed, wheezing. &#x201c;Or just enough, I suppose. Yes&#x2014;it was just enough.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen to me,&#x201d; the ghost insisted with a new urgency in his voice. &#x201c;You must build the bridge. Shakespeare&#x2019;s Bridge. You can&#x2019;t get back without it. But the bridge won&#x2019;t work without a trump.&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped and pulled one of the familiar silver watches from a broad pocket. He flipped it open and grimaced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told them,&#x201d; he murmured to himself. &#x201c;The loop should have closed.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles gripped John&#x2019;s shoulder, and looks of worry creased both men&#x2019;s faces. They were missing too many pieces of a far bigger picture here.<br><br>&#x201c;Hank,&#x201d; John began, &#x201c;perhaps if we&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must build Shakespeare&#x2019;s Bridge,&#x201d; Morgan said again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only way! The only way for you to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped and looked down at his watch, which had begun ticking. &#x201c;Oh, thank God,&#x201d; he murmured as he adjusted the dials on the device. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve finally managed to make a new&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>In midsentence, Hank Morgan vanished.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh my stars,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;What just happened here, Charles? What did we just see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing we can sort out on our own,&#x201d; Charles replied as he looked around the courtyard. Morgan was indeed gone, and whatever his cryptic message had meant, it was apparently all they were getting. &#x201c;Hank&#x2019;s supposed to be joining us at dinner later at Tamerlane House, anyway. We&#x2019;ll just take it up with him then. Maybe it&#x2019;s some sort of joke. To welcome us back?&#x201d;<br><br>John shook his head. Whatever else the ghost was, it was no joke. The age, the hard years that weighed on their old friend, were real. And that meant the warning was too.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; he said, spinning away on his heel. &#x201c;Jack will be waiting for us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Jack asked his friends as he ushered them into his rooms. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br><br>He knew by their demeanors that something was amiss. John went straight to the cupboard to fetch glasses for a drink, while Charles wearily draped himself in one of the chairs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure how to begin,&#x201d; Charles said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say we&#x2019;ve been having a little chat with a ghost.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; said Jack, smirking, as John handed him a snifter of brandy. &#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Old Pirate,&#x201d; Charles replied. &#x201c;You know, the one that appears at the base of the tower.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; said Jack after a moment. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re serious, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; John said, sitting next to Charles, &#x201c;but that&#x2019;s just the start of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Over the next several minutes, and a round of drinks, John and Charles related to Jack their experience with the ghostly Hank Morgan. When they had finished, he sat back and rubbed his forehead.<br><br>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;Two centuries is a long time to wait to deliver such a cryptic message.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got the impression that&#x2019;s all he could give us in the time he had,&#x201d; John noted, &#x201c;relatively speaking, that is.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles rubbed his chin, deep in thought. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s more than that,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;He said it only works if we spoke to him first, remember? I think that ghost may not have actually been Hank, but some kind of avatar that could speak only when spoken to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A recorded message?&#x201d; asked Jack. &#x201c;And interactive, to boot? That&#x2019;s some trick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;Who else but Hank would have the skills to pull it off?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Manipulating space as well as time,&#x201d; Jack said, pacing the width of the room. &#x201c;Not too many, I think. Alvin Ransom, probably. Rappaccini&#x2019;s daughter, maybe. Verne. Bert. Possibly Kipling. That&#x2019;s about it. There are others, associates of the Cartographer, who might have the skills, but they wouldn&#x2019;t have the need to send a message so indirectly. Not now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Associates?&#x201d; Charles asked. &#x201c;You mean apprentices, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not necessarily,&#x201d; replied Jack. &#x201c;Several of them were, but others ended up joining with Burton&#x2019;s Imperial Cartological Society.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Charles said as he leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br><br>The Imperial Cartological Society had operated as a sort of shadow organization to the Caretakers Emeritis. Comprised of rejected Caretakers, former Caretakers, and those men and women of history who might have been Caretakers in another time and place, the Society was dedicated to spreading knowledge of the Archipelago of Dreams and all its secrets&#x2014;by any means possible.<br><br>It was only after the Society was subverted by the Shadow King that there was a split among its ranks, and the de facto leader, Sir Richard Burton, brokered a truce with the Caretakers.<br><br>The Society would not attempt to spread knowledge about the Archipelago without the involvement and approval of the Caretakers Emeritis. And in return the Caretakers, under Jack&#x2019;s supervision, agreed to start a formal educational program at Cambridge in order to begin creating a greater awareness of the Archipelago among those who proved worthy to know of it.<br><br>It was an imperfect alliance, and it was likely to go through a succession of growing pains. But a tentative peace was better than war&#x2014;and they had all already had more than enough of war.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just say it, then,&#x201d; John said, rising to his feet. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we consider that this could be some sort of trick of Burton&#x2019;s? He&#x2019;s done it before.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack dismissed the question with a wave of his hands. &#x201c;Not using Hank, no,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And besides, he&#x2019;s sitting at the Caretakers&#x2019; table, so to speak. There&#x2019;s nothing he can gain through deception that hasn&#x2019;t already been offered to him on a silver platter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We can just bring it up with Hank when we get to Tamerlane House,&#x201d; Charles said, stretching as he rose to stand with his friends. &#x201c;After all, it can&#x2019;t be much of a crisis Hank was warning us about. Not if he had to go walking through two centuries just to deliver the message. Another day shouldn&#x2019;t matter that much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Speaking of walking,&#x201d; said Jack, &#x201c;we should start heading for the Kilns. That&#x2019;s where Ransom is expecting to take us through, and besides, I want to check in with Warnie and see if Mrs. Morris has shredded Magwich yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Morris?&#x201d; Charles asked. &#x201c;I thought your cat was a he.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Morris <i>was</i> a he,&#x201d; Jack replied, &#x201c;right up until the point she had kittens. It&#x2019;s been Mrs. Morris ever since.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have kittens? Charles asked. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t seen any.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, we don&#x2019;t let them roam the house,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;We keep them in the storeroom with that stupid talking shrub.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I really do appreciate you taking him on,&#x201d; Charles said apologetically. &#x201c;He and Michal were getting on horribly, and I had enough trouble with her already after I explained about the map tattooed on my back. Apparently, wives like to be consulted about that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe I ought to put him at Cambridge,&#x201d; he mused, &#x201c;make him the centerpiece of the new Imperial Cartological Society. Sort of a living cautionary tale about what happens when an evil henchman turned green knight mismanages his chance at redemption.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does it really count as a secret society if everyone knows it exists?&#x201d; Charles asked.<br><br>&#x201c;As I have begun to plan it,&#x201d; said Jack, &#x201c;it is most def...</p><h2>A Socialist Defector: From Harvard to Karl-Marx-Allee</h2><p>The circumstances that impelled Victor Grossman, a U.S. Army draftee stationed in Europe, to flee a military prison sentence were the icy pressures of the McCarthy Era. Grossman &#x2013; a.k.a. Steve Wechsler, a committed leftist since his years at Harvard and, briefly, as a factory worker &#x2013; left his barracks in Bavaria one August day in 1952, and, in a panic, swam across the Danube River from the Austrian U.S. Zone to the Soviet Zone. Fate &#x2013; i.e., the Soviets &#x2013; landed him in East Germany, officially the German Democratic Republic. There he remained, observer and participant, husband and father, as he watched the rise and successes, the travails, and the eventual demise of the GDR socialist experiment. <em>A Socialist Defector</em> is the story, told in rare, personal detail, of an activist and writer who grew up in the U.S. free-market economy; spent thirty-eight years in the GDR&#x2019;s nationally owned, centrally administered economy; and continues to survive, given whatever the market can bear in today&#x2019;s united Germany. <br><br>Having been a freelance journalist and traveling lecturer &#x2013; and the only person in the world to hold diplomas from both Harvard and the Karl Marx University &#x2013; Grossman is able to offer insightful, often ironic, reflections and reminiscences, comparing the good and bad sides of life in all three of the societies he has known. His account focuses especially on the socialism he saw and lived &#x2013; the GDR&#x2019;s goals and achievements, its repressive measures and stupidities &#x2013; which, he argues, offers lessons now in our search for solutions to the grave problems facing our world. This is a fascinating and unique historical narrative; political analysis told with jokes, personal anecdotes, and without bombast.</p><p><p><strong>Victor Grossman</strong>, born Stephen Wechsler, a New York red-diaper baby of the 1930s, joined the Communist Party as a Harvard student. Fleeing the U.S. Army during the McCarthy Era, he swam the Danube River to the Soviet Zone of Austria and was sent to East Germany. There, he studied journalism and became a freelance writer and popular speaker.

Richard Meltzer (a.k.a. R. Meltzer) took his training as a young philosopher and applied it with unalloyed enthusiasm to the lyrics, sound, and culture of rock and roll. Never before had anyone noticed the relationship between the philosophy of Heidegger and a tune by Little Anthony and the Imperials, heard the cries of agony in the Shangri Las' <i> Remember (Walkin' in the Sand)&#x201d;,</i> or transcribed every "papa-ooma-mow-mow" in the Trashmen's Surfin' Bird.&#x201d;From Dionne Warwick to Plato, Jim Morrison to Bert Brecht, Conway Twitty to Miguel de Unamuno, Meltzer subverts high and low culture in his search for meaning, emotion, and codes in popular music. At once an earnest investigation and a crypto put-on, the book can be read for its nuggets of information and insights or for its humor.

Drawing on evocative examples from philosophical texts, literature, and everyday life over centuries of Chinese history, Sterckx introduces major thinkers and traditions, illuminates key concepts like the <i>dao</i>, <i>qi</i>, <i>yin</i>, and <i>yang</i>, and examines questions of leadership, social order, death, nature, and more. He also reveals how these ideas shape contemporary China, from table manners at a traditional banquet, to the Chinese obsession with education and family, to the rhetoric of political leaders and the nation's grand strategy.

The art of Taiji Dao is a set of skills for using the dao, derived from the popular martial art Taijiquan. One of the most important aspects of Taijiquan practice is weapons training, eagerly pursued by students who have become adept in the basic skills of the art.<br><br><i>The Complete Taiji Dao </i>introduces the principles and practice of Taiji Dao and provides illustrated discussions of the history of Chinese swords. The book covers the history and features of the dao; the Taiji principles from which Taiji Dao practice derives; the basic skills and techniques of the art; detailed descriptions and photographs of the traditional Taiji Dao form; and Taiji Dao fighting principles and training methods. Broad in scope and detailed in its presentation of the principles and practice of Taiji Dao, <i>The Complete Taiji Dao </i>represents a significant contribution to the field of traditional Chinese weapons practice.</p><p>Since the 1990s, Zhang Yun<b> </b>has taught martial arts classes throughout the United States and has conducted more than 50 seminars worldwide. He is the author of <i>The Art of Chinese Swordsmanship: A Manual of Taiji Jian </i>and the translator of Lu Shengli&#x2019;s <i>Combat Techniques of Taiji, Xingyi, and Bagua. </i>He lives in Pittsburgh, PA."Handled well, the Taiji saber reflects the practitioner&#x2019;s skill level and depth of knowledge in applications and results. A sword master is sensitive to conditions and fully integrates body and mind in precise execution. The same can be said of Zhang Yun&#x2019;s skill in crafting this new book. Sensitive to readers&#x2019; needs, Zhang integrates the history, design, construction, and practice of the Chinese saber with great detail and clarity. The resulting work is an inspiring leap in the field of Chinese martial arts publications by presenting a major weapon in such a thorough way. It will be a standard reference work for decades to come."<br>&#x2014;Michael A. DeMarco, publisher, <i>Journal of Asian Martial Arts</i> <br> <br>"Martial arts books often include photos and extensive descriptions of the techniques, but that which is essential is not included. This book is different&#x2014;each movement and technique is accompanied by an exposition on what you should feel, and how to use your mind and body to engender that feeling. By &#x2018;feeling,&#x2019; I do not mean &#x2018;emotional state.&#x2019; I mean the physical organization you must develop to do the technique properly, using mental imagery, sensation, and the direction of attention to link up parts of the body so that one functions in an integrated fashion. I have never read a book that so clearly delineates what one should actually try to do while practicing an internal martial art. And that this is a book on weapons technique makes this all the more remarkable."<br>&#x2014;Ellis Amdur, author of <i>Old School: Essays on Japanese Martial Traditions</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Complete Taiji Dao: The Art of the Chinese Saber</i> by Zhang Yun is the most complete book on swordsmanship that I have seen yet. Zhang Yun provides very clear photos of all form work in the book, something that is usually difficult to read and put into practice. The book explains in great detail how Taiji principles are extended to weapon use as well as how the Taiji Dao is unique and different than conventional broadsword use. This book will stay with my collection forever.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Dojo Rat</p><h2>Beneath the Summer Sun (An Every Amish Season Novel)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Jennie Troyer knows it&#x2019;s time to remarry.

I think there is something wrong with the corner; a bad Feng Shui, or perhaps a terrible energy has snagged there. In the haunted punk rock flophouse I spent my twenties in, my bandmate Cheryl once told me black balls of energy were roosting in the corners of my kitchen &#x201c;like bats.&#x201d; Cheryl was clean and sober and Native American and a mystic; when she got into fights with people she prayed for them, which baffled and infuriated her enemies. I believe that there were bad energy bats flapping through that house because of the nightmares I&#x2019;d had, the prickly sensations, the creaking floorboards and the shadows moving room to room. Classic haunted house bullshit. The transient roommate population tended toward the alcoholic and the pill-addled, smokers of crystal meth and injectors of ecstasy. People with badly compromised psychic immune systems. None of us would have felt the sting of the bad energy bats as they sank their fangs into our auras and sucked out all the pretty colors.<br>Lying in my son&#x2019;s bed, as I do nearly every night, I wonder if the bad energy bats are with us, tucked into the spider-webby corner of his pale blue bedroom. He&#x2019;s been sleeping worse than usual, tossing and turning, crying tears through dreaming eyes. What do babies dream? Lying beside him one night, I too began to cry. At forty-five I seemed to have just realized I would never again be sixteen years old. I would never again feel what it feels like to be high on that particular mixture of youth and hormones, my still-pillowy brain not yet hardened to risk, everything possible, probable, permissible. When I think of being sixteen I think of wearing a very short black velvet dress, the torn hem dangling thread. My hair was home-bobbed, choppy and chunky, a harsh burnt-orange color, the result of a failed effort to bleach my hair out from a chemical black. I&#x2019;m drunk, of course. Did I land on sixteen because drinking never felt as good as it did that summer, drunk in the Boston Common, making out with boys, riding in the trunk of my best friend&#x2019;s car all the way to Worcester to see The Cure? The ghost of this girl hovered just above my son&#x2019;s bed, flapping her black wings, and I wept. Later I texted my sister: I&#x2019;m sobbing because I&#x2019;ll never be sixteen again. She texted back: I&#x2019;m sorry you will never be sixteen again. That&#x2019;s a hard truth. And I&#x2019;m sorry you have PMS. <br>It was not bad energy bats, of course. Later I lay on the couch and tearfully live-Tweeted my period. Amidst feelings of intense greasy zit bloat absurd horniness gross. <br>But then weeks later I lie in the same spot, and on the verge of falling asleep, have the startling revelation that there is no god. I get that feeling like stumbling from a curb; I jolt awake and quickly there are tears. My son, exhausted from kicking me repeatedly in the abdomen, sleeps through my jerk and sob. The despair is intense, the disappointment. This is all there is, a sprawling dark flash cracked like lightning the length of my universe. What will I pray to? I think dumbly. Oh, no more prayer. I realize that I actually love praying. Something I began skeptically on recommendation became a more habitual way to harness my mind became something that brings me real joy. I love sending love out to the world with my son each night as he falls asleep, even though he actually refuses love to most everyone. We send love from our hearts to Uncle Bear? No. We send love from our hearts to cousin Chloe and cousin Jude? No. Yes, we do, I insist, annoyed, and he responds, No, no, no, no no. Even a child can tell you there are no webs of magical energy strung between the hearts of those who love each other. I&#x2019;m a fool. Everything fun about life seems gone. I cry myself to sleep.<br>The next day I take a smoldering bundle of sage and walk it around the house, spending extra time in the corners above my son&#x2019;s bed. I tell my wife we&#x2019;ve got to move it to a different part of the room, it&#x2019;s got bad Feng Shui. I tell her about my crying jags. What the fuck do I care about never being sixteen again? I rant. I hate nostalgia. Same for god or no god. I pray regardless, because it makes me feel good and even science has acknowledged it changes your brain. Changing my brain is my favorite high. I pop three Celexa a day with the intention of sinking new grooves into that busted record. Have you been taking your meds? She asks. Yup. This has to be a magical problem.<br>It&#x2019;s hard to know where to put my son&#x2019;s bed. The room is small and cluttered with toys, with dressers and shelves. I lay down with him again, stretched out beneath the flap of the bad energy bats. Drowsy, I think about how in my last book I called an ex-boyfriend &#x201c;Cruise Dude.&#x201d; Because he took me on a cruise, a bad cruise, the most miserable two weeks of my life, as is the point of the story. &#x201c;Cruise Dude.&#x201d; I cringe. Why did I call him that? I feel utterly humiliated. We will never, ever be friends again; how could such a moniker ever be forgiven. &#x201c;Dude,&#x201d; a shade less grotesque than &#x201c;Bro.&#x201d; Named after a two-week getaway, no identity outside the bad feelings he gave me, barely a mention of the decades of friendship that preceded our doomed affair. I vaguely remembered a fuck it feeling as I wrestled with what to call him. Cruise Dude was a placeholder that stuck; mostly I didn&#x2019;t want to care too much about it. There is a certain stance you must take to write a memoir, a spell you cast upon yourself at the keyboard. You must not remember that your characters are actual people, people you once loved or maybe still do. Cruise Dude was brought into my memoir to illuminate a point, that I had dated people I shouldn&#x2019;t have, and thusly have learned hard romantic lessons. Still, why didn&#x2019;t I call him, like, Charles, or something? Shutting the laptop on that passage, I had smirked internally. Look &#x2013; he didn&#x2019;t even warrant a name in the book of my life. That&#x2019;s what you get, Cruise Dude! If you don&#x2019;t like it &#x2013; goes the memoirist&#x2019;s familiar refrain &#x2013; you shoulda acted right! It felt good enough at the time. Now, in bed beneath the bad energy bats, a low-level shame pervaded my body. How petty. I always told students not to write for revenge, just tell the story, but when your story is I&#x2019;ve been done wrong how can you help but steal a morsel of pleasure from the inherent vengeance of tattling? How can you, the wounded author, be trusted?<br>If I understood the desire to confess, it would have saved me a great deal of unhappiness. That is neurologist Alice W. Flaherty in her book The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer&#x2019;s Block and the Creative Brain. Neurologists have found that changes in a specific area of the brain can produce hypergrafia &#x2013; the medical term for an overpowering desire to write. Flaherty herself became hypergrafic in the storm of a post-partum depression that followed the late-term miscarriage of twins. She had always been wordy, but now her pen flew off the margin. Her brain had been changed. When she became happily pregnant a second time, her brain was changed still and the writing mania came back. Mental illness is not completely separable from sanity, she writes. There is a sense in which mental illness is awfully like sanity &#x2013; only much, much more so. <br>I have always written. In second grade I started a class newspaper, The Schoolyard Gazette, of which I was the Editor, Publisher and sole Staff Writer. Chicken Pox Is Sweeping the Second Grade rang my first, sensationalist headline. I did the comics page, inking a crude heart coming at another heart with an axe; Don&#x2019;t go breaking my heart! the caption quipped. When I too fell victim to Chicken Pox I decided to use the time to pen my first novel. Using a paperback as a model, I removed the scratch-proof socks I had on my hands and got to it. Beginning at the beginning, I drew my cover. With a glance at the back, I wrote some blurbs boasting of the story&#x2019;s special genius. Then I had to write the actual book. I was stumped. I returned to an earlier project, a humorous re-writing of the dictionary, where Abundance, for example, was a social mixer for pastries. <br>In fourth grade I took inspiration from the headlines of the garish Boston Herald American, the low-brow alternative to the Globe and what my grandfather read at the dinner table. When a young girl was finally killed by a mother who had long abused her, I wrote a fictionalized version and dedicated it to her memory. After scanning a piece about the unfair treatment endured by developmentally disabled individuals I penned a short story called The Retard&#x2019;s Sister. In it, a girl makes a wish that her sister die so that the horrible kids at her school will stop teasing her. And her sister does die, and the guilt is such that she will never again have a happy day for the rest of her punishingly long life. In fifth grade I wrote scripts for The Facts of Life, in particular one wherein Jo inveigles The Go-Go&#x2019;s to perform at a dance at Eastland Prep. In sixth grade I tried to adapt Judy Blume&#x2019;s Blubber into a play. In seventh grade I mainly wrote and rewrote Billy Idol lyrics into Lisa Frank notebooks. <br>Then, when I was twenty-one, powerful things happened. I realized I could have sex with girls, and my life exploded. I realized all of society and culture was a misogynist conspiracy to oppress women, and that this web of oppression tangled with other oppressions, racism, say, or how people liked to beat up homeless people, or go fag-bashing; it linked up with anti-Semitism, Fascism. The connection between a police officer in Provincetown who would not allow me to sunbathe topless on the beach and the obliteration of generations at Buchenwald were so clear to me they stung my brain. When I called the cop a Nazi, I meant it. The way agriculture is produced, with chemicals, harvested by brown people sleeping in tents and pissing in the hot sun, was linked directly to slaughterhouses which was linked directly to American slavery. I stopped eating. My stepfather admitted he had been spying on me and my sister, for many years, through holes he&#x2019;d carved into our walls. This was no different than my mother phoning our old landlord, a friend she had had a falling out with, to warn that a Haitian family was coming to view the apartment. None of this was any different than the dumping of nuclear waste into third-world dumps where workers brought the glowing material back to their children, to delight and kill them. My brain was thoroughly changed. <br>I moved to San Francisco, and began writing. In earnest. I remember being inside a night club, sitting up on top of a jukebox, scribbling into my notebook by the light that escaped it. All around me the darkness writhed with throngs of females, their bodies striped and pierced, shaved and ornamented as any tribe anywhere, clad in animal skins, hurling themselves into one another with love. What feeling it filled me with. An alcoholic, an addict, I know what it is to crave and the need to take this story into my body was consuming. For years I sat alone at tables, drunk, writing out the story of everything I had ever known or seen. Hypergrafia manifests primarily as personal narratives, memoir. My brain did this to me.</p></p><h2>The Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy</h2><p>In this compelling book&#x2014;mysteriously suppressed on its initial publication&#x2014;former FBI agent William Turner and investigative reporter Jonn Christian expose convincing evidence that Sirhan did not act alone. Based on more than ten years of intensive research, Turner and Christian raise serious questions about RFK&#x2019;s murder: �What was the virtually apolitical Sirhan&#x2019;s motive? �Why, if Sirhan was standing in front of his victim, were the fatal wounds in the back of Kennedy&#x2019;s head? �Why were there too many spent bullets (some the wrong size) for Sirhan&#x2019;s gun? �Did the LAPD discredit witnesses, try to make them alter their stories, and destroy key records? �Was Sirhan, in fact, a &#x201c;Manchurian Candidate,&#x201d; programmed through hypnosis either to kill Kennedy or divert attention while others did the job? The Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy makes the case that the murder of RFK, and the subsequent police and government investigations, bear all the hallmarks of the conspiracy surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the resulting Warren Commission. It is a fascinating and chilling reexamination of the tragic events that undoubtedly changed the course of American history.</p><p>In Superstructuralism, Harland coins the term to cover the whole field of Structuralists, Semioticians, Althusserian Marxists, Foucaultians, and poststructuralists -- Derrida, Kristeva, Barthes, Deleuze, Guattari, Foucault and Baudrillard included -- in spite of the differences among them.</p><h2>Albert York</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Reproducing some 60 paintings and drawings along with vintage press clippings, <i>Albert York</i> is a gorgeous, serious-minded thing.&#x201d; &#x2013;Martin Herbert, <i>ArtReview</i></strong></p><p>Art critic Calvin Tomkins has called Albert York (1928&#x2013;2009) &#x201c;the most highly admired unknown artist in America.&#x201d; Over the course of three decades, York&#x2019;s small paintings of landscapes, flowers, cows and figures have proven among the most quietly transcendent pictures of our time. Because he worked on the east end of Long Island, far from the center of the Manhattan art world, York&#x2019;s art remained something of a secret, albeit one with a devoted following. His admirers included Fairfield Porter, Susan Rothenberg, Paul Mellon, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Edward Gorey, who once said he would &#x201c;buy anything of York&#x2019;s, sight unseen, if anything were available.&#x201d;<br><br>Originally published in 2015 and quickly going out of print, this book provides the first substantial overview of this reclusive artist.

Dr. Feldenkrais developed the program as emergency training for soldiers in World War II. Through ten one-hour lessons, soldiers learned to defend themselves against an armed opponent in the most rapid and effective way possible. The program is based on one Judo technique. Feldenkrais emphasized concepts of the learning process throughout the book. He encouraged the reader to maintain a relaxed attitude, to start with slow and precise movements as he explained the timing, and to master the movements by repetition. The result would be a spontaneous movement which was correct and precise. He claimed that a fighter must first acquire the ability and then put it to practical use. Thus, the first three lessons teach the core technique, Hadaka-Jime. The remaining lessons implement the technique in a variety of situations against armed or unarmed attacks from different directions all of which culminate in the use of the core technique. This approach deepens the learning so that the fighter can effectively perform the core technique with many alternatives to survive the situation.</p><p>Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., a physicist, served as a scientific officer in the British Admiralty in World War II. During his time in the British Army he taught Judo to the officers and soldiers, which led to the publication of Practical Unarmed Combat. Dr. Feldenkrais authored four more books on martial arts, Ju-Jitsu and Self Defense (1931), ABC du Judo (1938), Judo: The Art of Defense and Attack (1941), and Higher Judo (1952). After meeting Jigoro Kano, he was active in promoting Judo in France and in founding the European Judo Union. In 1950 Feldenkrais moved to Israel where he was given a position in the Science Department of the Israeli Defense Forces. He left in 1953 to focus on the development of what is known today as the Feldenkrais Method.� He authored numerous books on his method including, Body and Mature Behavior, Awareness Through Movement, and The Potent Self. ------------ Moti (MORDEHAI) Nativ Born in Israel in 1950, Moti Nativ started formal martial arts training in 1966 on the wrestling team of the Horace Mann High School in Gary, Indiana where he lived for two years with his uncle. Today, Moti is Shihan (Master teacher) in the Bujinkan school for Budotaijutsu/Ninjutsu, he holds black belt in Judo, is a Certified Krav Maga instructor by the Israeli army and is head of International Bujinkan Shiki Dojo, teaching martial arts in Israel, Europe and the United States. In 1994, Moti became a Certified Feldenkrais Practitioner. Moti specializes in teaching the Feldenkrais Method to martial artists in a program called Warrior s Awareness. Thus began his research into the early years of Moshe Feldenkrais and the influence of martial arts on the development of the Feldenkrais Method. From his research, he has developed a workshop called the Fighting Roots of the Feldenkrais Method, which he teaches world-wide. Moti served 23 years in the Israeli Defense Force, retiring in 1991 as a Colonel. Moti continued to serve for 17 years in the Israeli State Comptroller Office, and retired in 2008 after 10 years as the Director of the Information System division.Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais was a remarkable man; teacher, soldier, researcher, judoka, visionary, martial artist, physicist, and pioneer. He was a founder of the European Judo Union, and respected by Gunji Koizumi, Mikinosuke Kawaishi, and Jigoro Kano. I therefore consider it an honour and a privilege to have been asked to write an endorsement to the new edition of his important text. I met Moti Nativ when he visited the Bowen History of Judo Archive at University of Bath to continue his research into the life and work of Moshe Feldenkrais. I was immediately struck by his passion and commitment, and his depth of understanding into the relationship of mind and body as applied to Budo. For me this book speaks on three levels. It is a treatise of an effective course of unarmed combat which has withstood the test of time. It is also an important document of social and cultural history when considered in the context that it was written. Thirdly it provides a level of insight for the advanced follower of the Feldenkrais Method� into the early thought processes of the founder. Moti Nativ and Genesis II Publishing are to be commended for reminding us about the relevance of this text, and sharing with us the thoughts of a remarkable man. --Dr. Mike Callan, President, The International Association of Judo Researchers, International Judo Federation Sixth Dan<br><br>This impactful book reveals a pioneer who is equal parts warrior and educator, and offers a snapshot of a method in the midst of its making. If you follow the trajectory of training outlined in this book, you ll find the very same strategies and techniques that become the basis of Dr. Feldenkrais yet-to-be-announced method. By teaching only one martial arts technique, Feldenkrais creates a lesson-like experiment, rich in the interplay of theme and variation. The training reveals the big picture as it clarifies the details and, just as the student begins to put it all together, Moshe changes the action s orientation to space. And so on! Thank you, Moti, for making this book available once again. The beautiful, user-friendly design is a fitting tribute to its historical importance. --Larry Goldfarb, Feldenkrais� Trainer<br><br>This is a small book with big ideas. Utilizing his deep understanding and mastery of Judo, Moshe Feldenkrais created a course in practical unarmed self defense for the British during WWII. However, it was in how he addressed his task that we see the mind of a genius at work. Feldenkrais merged age old, Oriental self-defense techniques with the explanatory power of science, combined with his own unique brand of pedagogy to create a novel self defense strategy that is easy to learn and use. Based on the slow and thorough learning of one technique and its applications, the ten lessons artfully disarm the fears and apprehensions of those being trained while giving them the expertise necessary to succeed in combat. For the discerning reader a central idea will become evident: that if one first trains the act to be accomplished from its ending it allows for many beginnings. Once an act, here a particular stranglehold, is learned in its simplest form and becomes second nature and can be performed unselfconsciously, then that simple unitary act can be made either more complex or made to fit more complex situations. The approach taken in this book is consonant with the basis of all Feldenkrais approach to learning. It will be of unquestioned value to both martial artists and Feldenkrais practitioners. Moti Nativ is to be commended not only for bringing this book out of retirement but also for his introduction and commentaries which convey the observations of a true teacher of the martial arts and a Feldenkrais Practitioner. --Dennis Leri, Feldenkrais Trainer and Martial Artist</p><h2>The Scandinavian Baltic Crusades 1100&#x2013;1500 (Men-at-Arms)</h2><p><p>Wielding their swords in the name of their faith, the crusaders originally set out to reclaim Jerusalem and its surrounding territory in the Middle East. Increasingly, however, Eastern Europe and the last remaining bastions of pagan Europe became the targets of their religious zeal.</p><p>The era officially began in 1147, when the Saxons, Danes, and Poles, responding to Pope Eugene III's call, initiated a crusade against the Wends of the Southern Baltic. This was followed by crusades against the Livonians, Estonians, Finns, Prussians, and Lithuanians. By the 13th century much of the responsibility for sustaining these crusades fell to the Teutonic Knights, a military order formed in the Holy Land in 1190. They were aided by the constant support of the Roman pontiff and by a steady flow of mercenaries from throughout Christendom.</p><p>The subsequent Scandinavian campaigns laid the foundations of modern Baltic society by destroying pagan rural farming settlements, and establishing fortified Christian towns and major castles. As with the majority of crusades, the prospective acquisition of land and power was the one of the key driving forces behind these bloody military expeditions. </p><p>This book reveals the colorful history of these Crusades when the soldiers of the Pope fought their way across Eastern Europe and inexorably changed the future of the continent.</p></p><p><p>David Lindholm MA, was born in 1970.

Invading armies from Germany--the Holy Roman Empire--saw the creation of the defensive Lombard League of northern Italian city-states. These struggles resulted in conflicts between rival confederacies, which in turn proved to be the catalysts for developments in organization and tactics. Italian urban militias became better organized and equipped, the Imperial armies went from being mostly German to multinational forces, and both sides became reliant on mercenary forces to prosecute their wars. </p><p>After the 1260s, France, relying mainly on armored cavalry, and Spain, with their innovative light infantry, vied for control of southern Italy. On the seas, the great naval powers of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice became fierce rivals, as they created great trading empires, bringing the treasures of the east into feudal Europe.</p></p><p><p><b>Gabriele Esposito</b> is an Italian freelance author on military history, specializing in uniformology, who has written a number of titles for Osprey Publishing, Pen &amp; Sword, Winged Hussar Publishing, and Partizan Press, and is a regular contributor to many magazines such as <i>Ancient Warfare</i>, <i>Medieval Warfare</i>, <i>Classic Arms &amp; Militaria</i>, <i>Guerres et Histoire</i>, <i>History of War</i>, and <i>Focus Storia Wars</i>.

Variously called handgonnes, hackbuts, coulevrines, pistolas, schiopettos, tyufyaks, and even bombardelles, the first black powder infantry weapons were extremely crude by today's standards. In his new book, Sean McLachlan, author of American Civil War Guerilla Tactics, dispels the myth that these weapons were ineffective on the battlefield (beyond their terrifying noise!). &nbsp;Rather, he demonstrates through careful examination of the historical records that the handgonne was a viable weapon from its inception in the early 14th century, even as it saw action side-by-side with the cross-bow.</p><p>Readers will be treated to a lush collection of rare photographs and artwork from such far-flung locales as Danish National Museum and the Bayerisches Armeemuseum.

This event is well-known, but there was another uprising that Rome faced shortly before, which lasted from AD 6 to 9, and was just as intense. This rebellion occurred in the western Balkans (an area roughly corresponding to modern Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro and parts of Serbia and Albania) and it tested the Roman Empire to its limits. For three years, fifteen legions fought in the narrow valleys and forest-covered crags of the Dinaric Mountains in a ruthless war of attrition against an equally ruthless and determined foe, and yet this conflict is largely unknown today. _The Great Illyrian Revolt_ is believed to be the first book ever devoted to this forgotten war of the Roman Empire. Within its pages, we examine the history and culture of the mysterious Illyrian people, the story of how Rome became involved in this volatile region, and what the Roman army had to face during those harrowing three years in the Balkans.</p><p>Jason R.

It was that she'd have heard him cursing if he had.<br><br>A fat, woolly sheep stared up at her from the boggy grass as if to say, <em>"You might be an FBI agent back in Boston, but out here in the Irish hills, you 're just another hiker with wet feet."</em><br><br>"This is true," Emma said, setting her backpack on the expanse of rough gray rock. "However, I'm prepared. I have dry socks."<br><br>She unzipped her pack and dug out a pair of fresh wool socks. The sheep bleated and meandered off, disappearing behind another knoll, one of a series on the windswept ridge on the Beara Peninsula, one of the fingers of land that jutted into the North Atlantic off the southwest coast of Ireland. It had been centuries since these hills were forested. She could see peeks of Kenmare Bay in the distance, its calm waters blue-gray in the midafter-noon November light. Across the bay, shrouded in mist but still distinct, were the jagged ridges of the Macgil-licuddy Reeks.<br><br>Emma kicked off her shoes, sat on the bare rock ledge and pulled off her wet socks. She glanced down at the narrow valley directly below her, a small lake shimmering in the fading sunlight. She and Colin were five hours into their six-hour hike. With the short November days, they would get back to their car just before dark.<br><br>As she put on her dry socks, he came around the knoll where her sheep had disappeared. A light breeze caught the ends of his dark hair, and he had his backpack hooked on one arm as he jumped over the wet spot that had fooled her.<br><br>He climbed up onto her knoll and dropped his pack next to hers. "I like having you walk point," he said with a grin.<br><br>"No fair. You saw my footprint in the mud."<br><br>"I'll never tell."<br><br>Emma leaned back against her outstretched arms. She had on a wool hat, her fair hair knotted at the nape of her neck. She had pulled her gloves on and off over the course of the day. She didn't know if Colin had even packed a hat and gloves. He was, she thought, the sexiest man she had ever met. Small scars on his right cheek and by his left eye from fights he said he had won. She had no doubt. He was strongly built, rugged and utterly relentless.<br><br>A good man to have on your side in a fight.<br><br>She was fit and lean and could handle herself in a fight, and although she wasn't tiny, he could easily carry her up a flight of stairs. In fact, he had, more than once.<br><br>They had set out early. For the past two weeks, they had explored the southwest Irish coast on foot and by car, by mutual agreement avoiding talk of arms traffickers, thieves, poison, attempted murder and alligators. Colin would wink at her and say he especially didn't want to talk about alligators, not that he had seen one on his narrow escape from killers in South Florida. Thinking about them had been enough.<br><br>By unspoken agreement, he and Emma also avoided talk of their futures with the FBI&#x2014;or even each other. His months of intense undercover work, in an environment where everyone was a potential enemy, had taken a toll, and he needed this time to be in the present, to be himself.<br><br>Emma's needs were simpler. She just wanted to be with him.<br><br>It was her life that was complicated.<br><br>She sat up straight, noticing that Colin's boots and cargo pants were splattered with mud but not wet like hers. She grinned at him. "You do know I've spent more time hiking the Irish hills than you have, don't you?"<br><br>"Beneath that placid exterior beats the heart of a competitive federal agent." He made no move to sit next to her. "Your mishap gives me an excuse to run a hot bath for you when we get back to the cottage."<br><br>"Life could be worse. You're not bored, are you?"<br><br>"I can go more than two weeks without anyone trying to kill me."<br><br>As he stood next to her on her boulder, his smile almost reached his stone-gray eyes.<br><br>Almost.<br><br>He offered her a sip from his water bottle, but she shook her head. He took a long drink as he gazed out at the hills. Except for the occasional <em>baa</em> of the grazing, half-wild sheep, the silence was complete.<br><br>"What are you thinking about, Colin?"<br><br>"Guinness."<br><br>"A cold pint and a warm pub. Sounds perfect."<br><br>He leaned down and touched the curve of his hand to her cheek. "It's been good being here with you." He winked at her as he stood straight. "Mud and sheep dung and all."<br><br>Emma sighed as she slipped back into her trail shoes and tied the laces. "No escaping sheep dung out here, is there? I wasn't distracted when I stepped in the wet spot. I just misjudged. There's a difference."<br><br>"But you do have a lot on your mind," Colin said.<br><br>She always did. Their jobs with the FBI attested to their different natures. He was an undercover agent. She specialized in art crimes. She was analytical, methodical, detailoriented. He was direct, intuitive, quick and decisive&#x2014;and independent to a fault. Six weeks ago, he had been assigned to her small team in Boston, if only because the senior agent in charge was determined to rein him in.<br><br><em>Good luck with that,</em> Emma thought. She stood, lifted her backpack and slung it over her shoulders. "The rest of the way is all downhill."<br><br>"Have you ever done this hike before?"<br><br>She shook her head. "First time."<br><br>"It's a good spot," he said, tucking his water bottle in his pack.<br><br>"I'm glad we did this before I go home."<br><br>"Yeah. Me, too."<br><br>It was Monday. She had a flight back to Boston on Friday. She'd be at her desk a week from today. Colin had more time before he had to decide what was next for him. Not a lot more time, but he could stay in Ireland for a while longer, without her.<br><br>She angled a look at him. "Anything on your mind, Colin?"<br><br>"I had an email from Andy in my in-box this morning. He sent it last night. I didn't read it until just now, while I ate an energy bar and admired the view. Reading email is against our hiking rules, I know."<br><br>"A sign it's time to get back to work, maybe." Emma gave him a moment but he didn't take the bait and respond, and she let it go. "How are things in Rock Point?"<br><br>"Andy says Julianne Maroney is leaving for Ireland tonight."<br><br>"Tonight? Isn't that sudden?"<br><br>"She's just accepted a marine biology internship in Cork that starts in January. She decided to come for a couple weeks now and get herself sorted out. It's sudden, but that's Julianne."<br><br>"So, she's staying in Cork?"<br><br>"A village east of Cork. Declan's Cross."<br><br><em>Declan's Cross.</em><br><br>Emma went still as a dozen images came at her at once. A pretty seaside Irish village of brightly colored shops and residences. A romantic mansion with sweeping views of cliffs and sea. Haunting Celtic crosses on a grassy hilltop.<br><br>A tight-lipped old Irish sheep farmer.<br><br>Her grandfather, Wendell Sharpe, a renowned art detective, pacing in his Dublin office as he admitted he and Sharpe Fine Art Recovery were after a thief they couldn't catch.<br><br>A thief, Emma thought, who had first struck in tiny Declan's Cross on a lonely, rainy, dark November night ten years ago.<br><br>She'd only become involved in the case four years ago, in the months between her life as Sister Brigid at the coastal Maine convent of the Sisters of the Joyful Heart and her life as a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She'd worked side by side with her grandfather in Dublin, learning everything he knew.<br><br><em>Not everything.</em><br><br>Wendell Sharpe never told anyone everything.<br><br>She was aware of Colin's eyes narrowed on her. He wouldn't know about the thief. There was no reason for him to know.<br><br>She pushed back her thoughts. "Why Declan's Cross, Colin?"<br><br>"Emma..."<br><br>"Just tell me what you know. Please."<br><br>"All right." He was plainly suspicious now. "A woman who's launching a marine science research facility in Declan's Cross stopped in Rock Point last week. She and Julianne hit it off. Now Julianne's meeting her there."<br><br>"To help with this research facility?"<br><br>"Andy doesn't have any details. He hasn't talked to Julianne himself.<br><br>"Then who told him?"<br><br>"Her brother. Ryan. He's in the Coast Guard, but he's in Rock Point visiting for a few days. He found out from their grandmother. Julianne lives with her."<br><br>Rock Point was a small, tight-knit southern Maine fishing village. Everyone knew everyone else's business, but Julianne's short-lived romance with Andy Donovan, third-born of the four Donovan brothers, apparently had come as a surprise, especially since she'd vowed never to get involved with a Donovan. Emma didn't know either Andy or Julianne well. She'd only met Colin in September and was still figuring out who was who in his hometown.<br><br>"What's this woman's name?" she asked. "Do we know her?"<br><br>"Her name's Lindsey Hargreaves. I don't know her."<br><br><em>Hargreaves.</em> Emma searched her memory but shook her head. "I don't, either. Did she come to Rock Point looking for Julianne?"<br><br>"I don't have any details. I just know Julianne's on her way to Ireland."<br><br>"And you don't like it."<br><br>"Julianne's as smart as they come, but she's impulsive and she's had a rough time lately. She's never been that far from home. I doubt she's been farther than Nova Scotia. Now all of a sudden she's meeting some strange woman in a little Irish village."<br><br>"Are you concerned she's running away because of her breakup with Andy?"<br><br>"I know she is," Colin said half under his breath. "This trip could be exactly what she needs, but I'd feel better if she wasn't alone."<br><br>"We could drive over to Declan's Cross tomorrow," Emma said.<br><br>He tilted his head back, eyed her again. "We could, but what's going on? I noticed your look when I mentioned Declan's Cross. Emma, is there a Sharpe connection to this village?"<br><br>She sighed. "We can talk on the hike back to the car."<br><br><strong>* * *</strong><br><br>They didn't talk on the hike back to their car or the drive back to their borrowed cottage in the Kerry hills across Kenmare Bay. Colin drove. He'd adjusted quickly to driving on the left, but the high, thick hedges and narrow roads&#x2014;each with its own quirks&#x2014;kept him on alert.<br><br>He'd known he and Emma wouldn't talk the moment he'd mentioned Declan's Cross and she'd given him that tight look. He liked to joke that he could do deep-cover work because he himself wasn't deep, but Emma was. She had layers of secrets. Sharpe secrets, Sister Brigid secrets, FBI secrets.<br><br>Emma secrets.<br><br>He didn't have secrets. He just had stuff he couldn't talk about.<br><br>And he had his demons. He'd come to Ireland because of them. His months of undercover work had taken a toll not just on him but on his family and friends&#x2014;and on Emma, even in the short time they'd known each other. They'd met in September on his brief respite at home in Rock Point.<br><br>Then he went away again, and when he came back, he'd brought some of his bad guys with him.<br><br><em>The short version,</em> he thought as he pulled into the gravel driveway of the little stone cottage he and Emma had shared for the past two weeks. He'd stayed here on his own for several days before she couldn't stand it any longer&#x2014;as she'd put it&#x2014;and got on a plane in Boston, flew to Shannon, rented a car and found him.<br><br>Colin hadn't asked her to turn around and go back to Boston without him.<br><br>Maybe he should have.<br><br>It was dark now, the wind shifting, turning blustery. He glanced at Emma, but she had already clicked off her seat belt and was slipping out of the car.<br><br>Definitely preoccupied.<br><br>He was in no rush. Let her take all the time she needed before she told him about the Sharpes and Declan's Cross. Wendell Sharpe had lived and worked in Dublin for the past fifteen years. Whatever was on her mind likely involved him. Colin had drunk whiskey with old Wendell. Interesting fellow. Maybe not quite the analytical thinker his granddaughter was but definitely a man with secrets.<br><br>Colin got out of the car, not minding the spray of cold rain. He grabbed their packs from the back and headed up a pebbled path to the cottage. The front door was painted a glossy blue, a contrast to the gray stone exterior. Finian Bracken, the owner, an Irish priest serving a parish in Rock Point, had told Colin to stay as long as he wanted. They'd become friends over the past few months, maybe as much because of their differences as in spite of them.<br><br>Fin couldn't bring himself to stay in the cottage. It was a reminder of his life before the priesthood, when he'd been a successful businessman, a husband and a father. He and his wife had renovated the tiny ruin of a place, adding a bathroom, kitchen, skylights, richly colored fabrics. It had been their refuge, he'd told Colin, a favorite spot to spend time with their two daughters.<br><br>Never in Fin's worst nightmares had he imagined he would lose all three of them. Sally, little Kathleen and Mary. They'd drowned seven years ago in a freak sailing accident.<br><br>Fin had removed any personal mementoes, but Colin thought he could feel the presence of his friend's lost wife and daughters and the happy times they'd had there.<br><br>He set the packs on the tile floor and pulled the door shut behind him. He liked being here. He liked having Emma here. The rest would sort itself out.<br><br>He watched her as she got on her knees and carefully, methodically, placed sods of turf in the stone fireplace. Colin liked the smell of burning peat, and a fire would warm up the single room and loft in minutes.<br><br>She rolled back onto her heels and stared at the fire as it took hold. Then she glanced up at him, the flames reflecting in her green eyes. "I hate to leave this place," she said.<br><br>"Ah, yes." He moved closer to her. "The cold, cruel world awaits."<br><br>She stood, and he slipped an arm around her waist, kissed the top of her head. Even her hair smelled like mud, but he didn't mind. She leaned into him. "I thought we'd have a few more nights together here. It's the most romantic cottage ever, isn't it? But we need to go to Declan's Cross, Colin. At least I do."<br><br>"There is a Sharpe connection to this village, then."<br><br>She eased an arm around his middle, the lingering tentativeness of even two weeks ago gone now. "I've reserved a room at the O'Byrne House Hotel," she said. "It's on the water, right in the village of Declan's Cross."</p><h2>Tefillin by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (1993-05-04)</h2><p>An explanation of the mitzvah of tefillin.

She sees into the child&#39;s dreams to find that events of the modern era have slipped through time into her mind, so she journeys far into the future to change the human imagination, the human dream, to expand it beyond the limitations imposed by empires and despots and all those afraid to live a life in balance with Nature. She learns to move through centuries, through many places and times, in order to confront the perpetrators of destruction on a grand scale and a small scale both, to dive deeply into their minds and hearts, and to offer them a clear vision of what they are doing and what they have done to all people, and what they will continue to do unless they face themselves honestly and with courage. She succeeds and fails, triumphs and falls, and like all of us, has to come to terms with herself on the deepest levels of reflection possible. No matter what, she must go on, for Agana knows that every moment in time touches every other moment in time, and in this, her mission is for the salvation of all children&#39;s dreams of what life can be, across every culture and era.

An eighteenth-century whore and pickpocket who runs off to join the Indians tells her story in a voice of bawdy authenticity. Carter immerses us in the worlds of Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Baudelaire, of khans, princesses, and kitchen boys, bringing them to life in prose of seductive richness and perverse wit. <br><br>In <i>The Bloody Chamber</i>, said <i>The New York Times Book Review,</i> Carter rewrote classic fairy tales "with all her supple and intoxicating bravura." In <i>Saints and Strangers, </i>she is just as audacious, and the result is a book of thoroughly contemporary folk tales that belong utterly to Angela Carter.</p><p><b>Angela Carter</b> (1940 -1992) wrote nine novels and numerous short stories, as well as nonfiction, radio plays, and the screenplay for <b>Neil Jordan's</b> 1984 movie <b>The Company of Wolves</b>, based on her story. She won numerous literary awards, traveled and taught widely in the United States, and lived in London.In <b>Saints and Strangers</b>, Angela Carter takes real people and literary legends - most often women - who have been mythologized or marginalized and recasts them in a new light. In a style that is sensual, cerebral, almost hypnotic, "The Fall River Axe-Murders" portrays the last hours before Lizzie Borden's infamous act: the sweltering heat, the weight of flannel and corsets, the clanging of the factory bells, the food reheated and reserved despite the lack of adequate refrigeration, the house "full of locked doors that open only into other rooms with other locked doors." In "Our Lady of the Massacre" the no-nonsense voice of an eighteenth-century prostitute/runaway slave questions who is civilized - the Indians or the white men? "Black Venus" gives voice to Charles Baudelaire's Creole mistress, Jeanne Duval: "you could say, not so much that Jeanne did not understand the lapidary, troubled serenity of her lover's poetry but, that it was a perpetual affront to her. He recited it to her by the hour and she ached, raged and chafed under it because his eloquence denied her language." "The Kiss" takes the traditional story of Tamburlaine's wife and gives it a new and refreshing ending. Sometimes disquieting, sometimes funny, always thought-provoking, Angela Carter's stories offer a feminist revision of images that lie deep in the public psyche. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>The Raw Life : Becoming Natural In An Unnatural World</h2><p>This Book will help you learn about health and to achieve your goals.

Cited as an influence by such envelope-pushing directors as Spike Jonze and P. T. Anderson, Altman has created a genre all his own, notable for its improvised, overlapping dialogue and creative cinematography. One of the key moviemakers of the 1970s--commonly considered the heyday of American film--Altman's irrepressible combination of unorthodox vision and style is most clearly evidenced in the fourteen movies he released across that decade. By fine-tuning his talent in a diverse array of genres, including westerns, thrillers, and loopy, absurdist comedies--all subtly altered to fit his signature m�tier--he cemented his place as one of our most esteemed directors.</p><p>In these conversations with David Thompson, Altman reflects on his start in industrial filmmaking, as well as his tenure in television directing <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> and <i>Bonanza</i>, and his big break in feature films as the director of the enormously popular <i>M*A*S*H</i>, a project for which he was the last possible resort behind fourteen other directors. The resulting portrait reveals a quixotic man whose films continue to delight and challenge audiences, both in the United States and beyond.</p></p><p><p><b>David Thompson</b>, a film scholar, has edited or co-edited several titles in the Directors on Directors series, including <i>Scorsese on Scorsese</i> and <i>Levinson on Levinson</i>.</p></p><h2>Green Lantern: The Silver Age Vol. 2</h2><p>The most famous of all the Green Lanterns, Hal Jordan put on the Lantern&#x2019;s ring for the first time in 1959. Reinvented from the original 1940s crime-fighting Green Lantern by John Broome, this new Green Lantern was a science-fiction adventurer. He battled aliens, giant monsters and wealthy sociopaths out to steal his ring, and fended off the efforts of his love, Carol Ferris, to discover his true identity. As the Green Lantern of the Silver Age of comic books, Hal Jordan captured the imagination of a space-minded society of the &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s.<br> &nbsp;<br> GREEN LANTERN: THE SILVER AGE VOLUME 2 collects the adventures of Hal Jordan as he takes on the responsibility of the ring and the lantern in GREEN LANTERN #10-22.</p><p>Born in 1913, John Broome started out his writing career selling science fiction stories to the pulp magazines of the 1930s. His agent for those stories was Julius Schwartz, who in 1945 would join DC Comics&#39; staff as an editor and, over the next forty years, be responsible for some of the most innovative comics of his time. Broome&#39;s first comic book sale was to Fawcett Comics for the South Seas adventure strip, Lance O&#39;Casey. More work for Fawcett followed, including on CAPTAIN MARVEL, before World War II interrupted his writing career. When he was released from the service, he looked up his old friend Julius Schwartz at DC and, for more than twenty years, made his creative home there, writing countless scripts for numerous features, including the Golden Age Green Lantern, Justice Society of America, Captain Comet, the Silver Age revival of Green Lantern, the Atomic Knights, Star Hawkins, Rex the Wonder Dog, Detective Chimp and a variety of science fiction tales. Broome retired from comic books in the 1970s and settled in Japan where he taught English. John Broome died in Thailand in March 1999.</p><h2>Jews and Ukrainians: A Millennium of Co-Existence</h2><p><p>There is much that ordinary Ukrainians do not know about Jews and that ordinary Jews do not know about Ukrainians. As a result, those Jews and Ukrainians who may care about their respective ancestral heritages usually view each other through distorted stereotypes, misperceptions, and biases.

Such a world requires a firm hand and a guiding light. But does it need the Concern: an all-powerful organization with a malevolent presiding genius, pervasive influence and numberless invisible operatives in possession of extraordinary powers?<br><br>Among those operatives are Temudjin Oh, of mysterious Mongolian origins, an un-killable assassin who journeys between the peaks of Nepal, a version of Victorian London and the dark palaces of Venice under snow; Adrian Cubbish, a restlessly greedy City trader; and a nameless, faceless state-sponsored torturer known only as the Philosopher, who moves between time zones with sinister ease. Then there are those who question the Concern: the bandit queen Mrs. Mulverhill, roaming the worlds recruiting rebels to her side; and Patient 8262, under sedation and feigning madness in a forgotten hospital ward, in hiding from a dirty past.<br><br>There is a world that needs help; but whether it needs the Concern is a different matter.</p><p>Iain Banks came to controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, <em>The Wasp Factory</em>, in 1984. <em>Consider Phlebas</em>, his first science fiction novel, was published under the name Iain M. Banks in 1987. He is now widely acclaimed as one of the most powerful, innovative and exciting writers of his generation.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda Iain Banks is well known for one crotchet that every reviewer of his work is obliged to mention: Under this name, the popular Scottish author writes edgy mainstream fiction, often psychological thrillers such as his unsettling first book, "The Wasp Factory" (1984). But as Iain M. Banks he produces science fiction, usually glorious space-operatic science fiction involving a future civilization called the Culture. In these latter books, human beings and sentient AI machines coexist as equal citizens of a pan-galactic utopia, one that has eliminated want, disease and other common social ills. The first two novels in the series are the evocatively titled "Consider Phlebas" -- a two-word quote from T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" -- and "The Player of Games." So, given the presence of that middle initial M., Banks clearly signals that "Transition" should be regarded as a science-fiction novel, even if it's not part of the Culture universe. Yet in Britain "Transition" was published sans M., as a literary thriller or apocalyptic fable, with contemporary social and political commentary attached. It is certainly that, too. In whichever edition you read it, though, Banks's new novel is wildly entertaining, albeit a bit confusing at first. The confusion initially arises because the narrative shifts among several voices and points of view. To all appearances the book seems to be juxtaposing at least four unrelated stories. In the sections labeled "Patient 8262," a man is being cared for in a hospital where the staff speaks a language he doesn't understand. He believes himself to be some kind of super-secret agent, now in hiding from his enemies. In those sections titled "Adrian," we follow a smart, ambitious young drug dealer as he climbs to social and financial success in contemporary London. From the pages assigned to "The Philosopher," we learn about the early years and background of a professional torturer. Only in those sections titled "The Transitionary" and "Madame d'Ortolan" does the novel grow clearly science fictional. Using the common sci-fi notion of the multiverse, Banks posits that there are an infinite number of parallel Earths. Our world -- the world of the Twin Towers and the Wall Street meltdown -- is one of them. But on another Earth, Christian Terrorism poses a serious threat to Western civilized values. There, public outrage at airport bombings has actually led to the socially condoned use of torture on prisoners. It couldn't happen here, of course. Still, the myriad Earths are superficially similar if hardly equal. On the all-important one called Calbefraques certain people have developed the power to shift their consciousness from one body to another. By taking over the "husk" of a person living in an alternate time-stream, a specially trained operative can "transition" between worlds. Obviously, such power must be controlled and carefully safeguarded by the Concern. This governing body -- helped by "foreseers" -- aims to do good for the various Earths, to nudge history down one path rather than another, to benefit multiple societies by carefully timed interventions in people's lives. In short, the body-snatchers "fix what is broken" or "stop things about to break from breaking in the first place." A brilliant young doctor halts to listen to a colleague's suddenly odd remarks -- and isn't killed when the elevator he was about to enter breaks free of its cables and plunges 20 stories to the ground. A mysterious stranger saves a Latin American teenager from being raped -- and thus she will grow up to become a world-renowned professor of psycho-semantics rather than commit suicide before the age of 20. Sometimes, though, the Concern decides that the only useful adjustment is "elision," i.e., the murder of a brutal dictator, for example, or the elimination of a fanatical billionaire with plans to start a political party to rid the United States of non-Aryans. For the most difficult or highly sensitive of these operations, the Concern relies on Temudjin Oh. Of Mongolian extraction, Oh lives, as he says, "an orderly, even quiet life, as entirely befits somebody who spends potentially highly disorienting amounts of time flitting between one world and the next, too often for the unfortunate purpose of killing people." One day Oh is called to a special meeting with Madame d'Ortolan, who countermands his most recent instructions with verbal orders to "elide" (kill) a half-dozen members of the Concern's Central Council. He questions the orders, but this imperious dragon lady reiterates that she and her colleagues have approved this course of action, reminds him that he is sworn to obey his superiors, and duly sends the assassin off to fulfill his mission. Nonetheless, Oh is troubled. Many years earlier he had been the student of the very sexy Mrs. Mulverhill, who has since become a traitor and outlaw, apparently determined to bring down the Concern. Mrs. Mulverhill insists that the powerful Madame d'Ortolan, now in absolute control of the Central Council, has a secret agenda. But what is it? So far Oh's former teacher can only speculate, though she has personal knowledge of hideous experiments being conducted on the apparently autistic to bring out latent but weird mental powers. Meanwhile, Banks keeps interrupting this science-fictional roller coaster with highly realistic accounts of Adrian snorting coke, sweet-talking an elderly hedge fund manager and generally being a joy to listen to, if impossible to quote at length here because of his fondness for various obscenities. When Adrian meets a "bint" in a bar, he tell us that "I . . . gave her the first-level cheeky smile, which has been known to melt many a girl's heart and other parts and which I am not ashamed to admit I have practised in the mirror, to get the effect just right. Hey -- it's for them in the end." Brazenly self-centered but more obnoxious than he realizes, Adrian almost steals the book away. Nonetheless, Banks will suddenly shift from Adrian's cocky monologues to the Philosopher debating the nature of justice with a prisoner, before going on to the mental confusion of Patient 8262, who is trying to figure out what is actually going on in the hospital where he is virtually imprisoned. And then, before too long, it will be back to the cat-and-mouse politics in Calbefraques. Whom can Temudjin Oh really trust? Certainly longtime readers of science fiction will find much that is vaguely familiar in "Transition." The decadent civilization of Calbefraques and the act of "transitioning" both call to mind Alfred Bester's seminal masterpiece, "The Stars My Destination." The mental control of other people's bodies and the sparring between powerful super-minds suggests Dan Simmons's "Carrion Comfort." The novel's overall current of paranoia adds a soupcon of "The Matrix" and Philip K. Dick. But what of the other seemingly realistic, even naturalistic sections of "Transition"? What of the graphic account of the Philosopher's first act of torture? What of the greed, egotism and libertarianism espoused by Adrian? What about Patient 8262's growing suspicion that he might be delusional? And what, too, of all the talk about solipsism and the tendency of power to craze as well as corrupt? Is there a pattern here? Of course there is. Suffice it to say that surprises are in store, as well as much slightly kinky lovemaking, a deliberate disordering of the senses in several bravura stylistic passages and, finally, a classic white-knuckle climax on the Rialto Bridge in Venice.

"La bella durmiente" ("The Sleeping Beauty"), recounts the brief life of a young dancer through letters and newspaper clippings that reveal much more than they say. And in "Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres" ("When Women Love Men"), a society lady and a prostitute form a startling alliance after the death of the man they both loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Richly imagined, elegantly written, Ferr�'s stories are early proof of her stature among contemporary Latin American writers.</p><p><br>Rosario Ferr� lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p><h2>White Trash Zombie Apocalypse</h2><p><b>Horror meets humorous urban fantasy in third book of the White Trash Zombie series<b>&nbsp;�</b>&nbsp;Winner of the 2012 Best Urban Fantasy Protagonist by the RT Awards</b><br><br>Our favorite white trash zombie, Angel Crawford, has enough problems of her own, what with dealing with her alcoholic, deadbeat dad, issues with her not-quite boyfriend, the zombie mafia, industrial espionage and evil corporations.

Her books have received many honors: ALA Notable, School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, Booklist Editor&#x2019;s Choice, IRA Teacher&#x2019;s Choice, Bulletin Blue Ribbon Book, and Boston Globe/Horn Book Honor Book. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri.Gr. 5-up. Specially commissioned, original poems celebrate some of the finest twentieth-century American art in this beautiful, surprising volume. Such well-known writers as Nancy Willard, X. J. Kennedy, Lee Upton, and Angela Johnson wrote poems inspired by artworks created through the century, but the book's organization is thematic rather than chronological. The poems are grouped according to how the writer responded to the art: some tell a story about the whole painting; some speak from the perspective of an object within the artwork; some transform the visual elements into poetic metaphors; some talk about the artists and their techniques. From a tight diamante and pantoum to lyrical free verse, the range of poetic styles will speak to a wide age group. Younger children, for example, will love Deborah Pope's "On Lichtenstein's 'Bananas and Grapefruit,'" which melts quickly down the page to a delicious ending: "gulppulp / sweet part / eat / art." Teens (and adults) will enjoy the inquisitive depth of such selections as Ronald Wallace's "Mobile/Stabile." Concluding with biographical notes on each poet and artist, this rich resource is an obvious choice for teachers, and the exciting interplay between art and the written word will encourage many readers to return again and again to the book.

While his focus is the space of time in which ancient Rome became a world power from 220 to 167 BC, Polybius also discusses his role as a &#39;pragmatic historian&#39;, a discourse on fate (called tyche), and the superiority of the mixed constitution. Though all forty volumes have not survived to the present day, the complete books extant today cover the affairs of all the important nations of the time, including Egypt, Greece, and Spain, as well as the first and second Punic Wars. Polybius speaks at length on the government of the Romans, citing it as the reason for Rome&#39;s success as a force of the world. Though it includes a couple of digressions concerning lesser issues of the time, &#34;The Histories&#34; has proven and continues to be a valuable text when studying the Hellenistic time period and manner of writing.</p><p></p><h2>All Kinds of Families: 40th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>In a book far ahead of its time, All Kinds of Families celebrated the broad diversity of American families when it was first published in 1976.

"What's your take, John Jasper? Motor pool morons set us on bake or broil?" &nbsp; <br><br>Jack Reed laughed and used a meaty, freckled forearm to clear sweat from his face. Scanning the night-darkened Dumpsters and butt-sides of shuttered, low-rent businesses that lined the alley, he sucked on his Parliament and blew smoke out the cruiser's window as Darius kept the car moving forward at ten mph. &nbsp; <br><br>Ten years ago, to the day, the Manson Family had butchered Sharon Tate and a whole bunch of other people. If either Fox or Reed was aware of the anniversary, neither thought it worth mentioning. &nbsp; <br><br>Crazy Charlie's crimes might as well have been on another planet; big-ticket outrage on high-end real estate. Fox and Reed's Southwest Division shifts were filled with nonstop penny-ante crap that sometimes blossomed into stomach-churning violence. Reality that never made the papers because, as far as they could see, the papers were works of fiction. &nbsp; <br><br>Fox said, "Man, it's a steam bath." &nbsp; <br><br>Reed said, "Alleged, as in this is a motor vehicle. More like a shopping cart with a cherry on top." <br><br>&nbsp; Fox had prepped for driving the way he usually did, hand-vacuuming the driver's portion of the bench seat, then wiping the steering wheel down with his private bottle of Purell. Now it was his own sweat coating the plastic. "Hand me a tissue, J.J." &nbsp; <br><br>Reed complied and his partner rubbed the wheel till it squeaked. &nbsp; Both men continued to study the alley as they crawled. Nothing. Good. One half of the shift had passed. &nbsp; <br><br>Jack Reed said, "Alleged, as in Jimmy Carter's a commander in chief." &nbsp; <br><br>"Now you're getting unpleasantly political." &nbsp;<br><br> "That's a problem?" &nbsp; "Night like this it is." &nbsp; <br><br>"Truth is truth, Darius. It was Peanut Boy helped that loony towel-head back into Eye-Ran and look at all the crap that brought down." &nbsp; <br><br>"No debate on Farmer Bucktooth being a nitwit, John Jasper. I just don't want to pollute our precious time together with small things like international affairs." &nbsp; <br><br>Reed thought about that. "Fair enough." &nbsp; <br><br>"I'm known for my fairness." &nbsp; <br><br>Slow shift; the usual drunk and disorderlies at Mexican dance halls on Vermont, a couple of false-alarm burglary calls, an assortment of miscreants warned and released because none of them was worth the paperwork. &nbsp; <br><br>The last call they'd fielded before embarking on alley-duty was yet another noise complaint at a USC fraternity, already taken care of by the campus rent-a-cops by the time Fox and Reed arrived. Rich, confident college boys saying yessir and nossir, scooping up beer bottles from the lawn, hurrying inside to continue the merriment. Wink wink wink. &nbsp; <br><br>Reed smoked his Parliament down to a shred, pinched it cold between his fingers, flicked the remnant out the window. He was a ruddy, blond fireplug, five nine on a good day, two hundred muscled pounds, thirty but looking older, with skin leathered by the sun and a nose flattened by high school football. A hay-colored crewcut topped his bullet skull. A naturally grainy voice was coarsened further by two packs a day. &nbsp; <br><br>Three years out of the service, all his time spent running an armory in Germany. &nbsp; <br><br>He said, "Tell you what alleged is, Darius: L.A. nights cooling off. Night like this, might as well have stayed in Bull Shoals." &nbsp; "And missed the opportunity to ride with me?" &nbsp; <br><br>Reed grinned. "Perish the thought." &nbsp; <br><br>"Damn heat," said Fox, dabbing sweat from his straight-edge mustache. He was a tall, rangy black man, thirty-one years old, a former air force mechanic who'd been told by many people that he was handsome enough to act. &nbsp; <br><br>Jack Reed, a small-town Arkansas boy, was comfortable with black people in a way northerners could never be. He found L.A. scary. Everyone pretending to love everyone else but the streets hummed with anger. &nbsp; <br><br>Working with a black man-sitting side by side, eating, talking, trusting your life to a black man-was a whole different level of comfort for a transplanted southerner, and he was surprised how fast he'd gotten used to riding with Darius. &nbsp; <br><br>Knowing what Darius was thinking without Darius having to put it into words. &nbsp; <br><br>He could only imagine what his cousins would say if he bothered to talk to them anymore, which he didn't. All that ignorance and stupidity was history. &nbsp; <br><br>He contemplated another cigarette as Darius exited the alley, drove a block, entered a neighboring back lane. More garbage and accordion-grated rear doors. &nbsp; <br><br>Same old same old; both patrolmen were bored and crazy-hot. &nbsp; <br><br>Darius used his forearm to wipe sweat off his chin. Shiny nails flashed. Jack resisted the urge to kid his partner about the weekly manicures. Night like this, no sense being tiresome. &nbsp;<br><br> Jack had been to Darius's neat little bungalow in Crenshaw for barbecues and the like, played with Darius's little boy, made chitchat with the woman Darius was supposed to be committed to till death do us. &nbsp; <br><br>Madeleine Fox was a small-waisted, curvy, strong-featured white girl who thought she was an artist but had no talent anyone else could perceive. Great teeth and hair, even better body. Those big soft . . . Jack imagined Darius getting close to her. Sliding down the bed and putting his manicured hands on . . . Jack's own face and body and hands transferred to the scene. &nbsp; <br><br>Feeling like a shit, he shut down the movie, lit up another Parliament. &nbsp; <br><br>"You okay?" said Darius. &nbsp; <br><br>"Yeah." &nbsp;<br><br>"You got fidgety. Pumping those knees, like you do." &nbsp; <br><br>"I'm fine." &nbsp; <br><br>"Okay." &nbsp; <br><br>"Okay, what?" &nbsp; <br><br>"You fidget when something's bugging you." &nbsp; <br><br>"Nothing's bugging me." &nbsp; <br><br>"Okay." &nbsp; <br><br>Jack said, "All that intuition, apply for detective." &nbsp;<br><br>"Big fun," said Darius. "Sitting on my ass all day typing, no more stimulating conversation with you? Not to mention fringe benefits?" &nbsp; <br><br>Jack had been riding with Darius for thirteen months, knew the perks his partner was talking about. &nbsp; Comped meals, "donations" of merchandise by grateful civilians. &nbsp;<br><br> Last week, both he and Darius had gotten brand-new pocket calculators from an Arab with a store on Hoover after they'd busted two kids trying to shoplift cassette tapes. &nbsp;<br><br> Darius's favorite perk had nothing to do with tangible goods. &nbsp;<br><br>Police groupies. Hit the right cop bar at the right time and they swarmed like ants on molasses. &nbsp; Sad girls, for the most part, not Jack's thing. But he didn't judge. <br><br> Sometimes he wondered, though. Darius married to a good-looking, downright sexy girl like Maddy, nice backyard, cute little Aaron. &nbsp; <br><br>Jack ever got married, he was pretty sure he'd never step out. &nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes he thought about Maddy, those teeth. The rest of the package. Sometimes that brought on headaches and long, itchy thoughts. Mostly when his crappy little single in Inglewood got real quiet and Penthouse wasn't gonna cut it. &nbsp;<br><br>Darius said, "Wind blows the heat in, then the heat just sits down and stays until another wind finally decides to kick its ass out of town." &nbsp; <br><br>Jack said, "Tonight's weather report is brought to you by Cal Worthington Dodge. Now for the latest on them Dodgers." &nbsp; <br><br>Darius laughed. "Nasty night like this, almost a full moon on top of the heat, you'd think we'd be having more fun." &nbsp; <br><br>"People carving each other up," said Jack. &nbsp; <br><br>"People shooting each other full of holes," said Darius. &nbsp;<br><br> "People stomping each other till the brains ooze out of their cracked skulls." &nbsp; <br><br>"People strangling each other till the tongues are sticking out like limp . . . salamis." <br><br>"For a moment I thought you were gonna say something else-hey, look at the land-yacht." &nbsp; <br><br>Pointing up the alley to a big white car idling, maybe ten yards up, pulled to the left. Lights off but the security bulb of a neighboring building cast an oblique band of yellow across the vehicle's rear end. &nbsp; <br><br>Darius said, "Caddy, looks pretty new. How come it's smoking worse than you?" &nbsp;<br><br> He rolled closer and each of them made out the model. &nbsp;<br><br> Big white Fleetwood, matching vinyl top, fake wire wheels. Tinted windows shut tight. &nbsp; <br><br>Someone's A.C. wasn't alleged. &nbsp; <br><br>Darius rolled close enough to read the tags. Jack called in the numbers. &nbsp; <br><br>One-year-old Caddy, registered to Arpad Avakian, address on Edgemont Street, no wants or warrants. &nbsp; Darius said, "East Hollywood Armenian. Bit of a drive to Southwest." &nbsp; <br><br>Jack said, "Maybe something worth driving for." &nbsp; <br><br>"Real worth driving for." &nbsp;<br><br>Both of them thinking the same thing without having to say it: no logical reason for Arpad Armenian or whoever was using his wheels to be in this crap-dump neighborhood in a newish luxury boat unless someone had a serious jones. &nbsp;<br><br>Dope or sex. <br><br>&nbsp; Or both. &nbsp; <br><br>Guy with a fresh Caddy had the potential to be a fun bust, bit of diversion from the brain-dead locals they usually dealt with. &nbsp; <br><br>If Arpad was polite, they might even let him go with a warning. Some of those Hollywood Armenians owned stereo stores and the like. Nothing wrong with chalking up another grateful civilian. &nbsp; <br><br>Darius got closer, put the cruiser in Park. Got out of the car before Jack could place his hand on the door handle. &nbsp; <br><br>Jack watched his partner hitch up his trousers, approach the Caddy with the cop swagger that originated when you learned to walk with all that heavy gear on your belt. Like making your way on the rolling deck of a boat; eventually, you came to like it. &nbsp;<br><br> Darius walked right up next to the Caddy, shined his flashlight at the driver's window, holding it high, the way they were trained, to prevent it being grabbed. His free hand hovered near his holstered .38, and Jack felt his own paw settling on his weapon. Nowadays everything had to be logged, so he called in the stop, caught a bad connection on the radio, tried twice more before reaching Dispatch. &nbsp;<br><br> Meanwhile, Darius was rapping on the window. &nbsp; <br><br>Tinted almost black. It stayed closed. &nbsp;<br><br> "Police, open up." &nbsp; <br><br>The Caddy sat there, smoking away. &nbsp; <br><br>Maybe suicide? Or a carbon mono accident? Normally, you had to be in an indoor situation to asphyxiate yourself with exhaust, but Jack had heard about venting gone bad. &nbsp; <br><br>"Open up now." Darius put that menacing edge in his voice. You'd never know this was a guy who loved his weekly salon manicure. &nbsp;<br><br> The Caddy's window remained shut. &nbsp;<br><br> As Darius repeated the command, he reached to unsnap his holster and Jack moved for his own gun and opened the cruiser's passenger door. &nbsp; <br><br>Just as he got to his feet, the window slid down silently. &nbsp; <br><br>Whatever Darius saw relaxed him. He dropped his gun arm. Smiled. &nbsp; Jack relaxed, too. &nbsp; "License and reg-" &nbsp; The night cracked. &nbsp; <br><br>Three shots in rapid succession. Each hit Darius square in the chest. Each caused him to buck. &nbsp; He didn't fall back the way they did in the movies. He sank down into a sitting position, hands flat on the asphalt, as the Caddy lurched into gear and shot forward. &nbsp; <br><br>At first glance, just a guy resting. &nbsp; <br><br>Crazily, Jack thought: He's okay. &nbsp; <br><br>Then Darius pivoted, half faced Jack. What looked like motor oil leaked through Darius's tailored navy shirt. His face was that of a stranger. &nbsp;<br><br> Jack screamed and fired at the fleeing car. Emptying his revolver as he ran to Darius. &nbsp; <br><br>"Oh man, oh Jesus, oh man, Lord Jesus . . ." &nbsp; <br><br>Later, he'd learn that one of his bullets had pierced the Caddy's rear window, but that hadn't slowed the big car down. &nbsp; Darius continued to sit there. Three wet holes in his chest. &nbsp;<br><br> Jack cradled him, put pressure on the wounds. "Hold on, Dar, you're gonna be fine, just hold on hold on hold on." &nbsp; Darius stared at the sky with dull, sightless eyes. &nbsp; His mouth gaped. &nbsp;<br><br> Jack felt for a pulse. Gimme something, c'mon, c'mon, gimme . . . &nbsp; Darius's skin turned to ice. &nbsp; <br><br>Jack began CPR, covering Darius's cold mouth with his own. &nbsp; <br><br>Like breathing into an empty cave. &nbsp; Darius lay there. &nbsp; Still as the heat that had blown in from the desert and decided to stay. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><i><br>Chapter Two</i><br>By now, Aaron Fox understood Mr. Dmitri. &nbsp; <br><br>Once a level of trust had developed, he'd stay out of your face. &nbsp; <br><br>Aaron's favorite type of client. &nbsp; Real deep pockets made Mr. Dmitri the perfect client. &nbsp; <br><br>Before his first meeting with the guy, Aaron had done his usual research. Googling Leonid Davidovitch Dmitri and coming up with two dozen hits, the most informative a rags-to-riches tale in a business journal: Moscow born, trained as an electrical engineer, Dmitri had been stuck for fifteen years in a dead-end Communist job measuring noise levels at restaurants and filing reports that never got read. At the age of thirty-seven, he'd emigrated to Israel, then the U.S., taught night school math and physics to other Russians, tinkered in his kitchen, inventing numerous objects of dubious value. &nbsp; Ten years ago, he'd patented a tiny, wafer-thin stereo speaker that produced outsized sound and was perfect for cars-especially high-end sports models with their limited cabin space. &nbsp; <br><br>Aaron's Porsche had been outfitted with Dmitri's gizmo when he'd had it customized and the fidelity was kick-ass. &nbsp; The article estimated Mr. Dmitri's net worth at a couple hundred million, and Aaron was expecting to meet some tycoon sitting behind an acre of desk in an over-the-top inner sanctum crammed with imitation Faberg� and God knew what else. &nbsp; What he encountered was a short, bald, stubby-limbed, bullnecked man in his late fifties with a pie-tin face blued by stubble, sitting behind a plywood desk in a no-window hole at a factory in a Sylmar industrial park. &nbsp;<br><br> Dmitri was maybe five five, at least two hundred, lots of that muscle, but also some fat. Dark brown laser-sharp eyes never stopped moving. &nbsp; <br><br>Two hundred biggies, but the guy wasn't spending it on wardrobe. Short-sleeved pale blue shirt, baggy gray pleated pants, gray New Balances. Aaron came to learn that it was Dmitri's uniform. &nbsp; Cheap digital watch. &nbsp; <br><br>Fake-o tongue-and-groove covered all four walls of the office.

Drizzle dissolved the close horizons and blurred heaven and earth into a grey cocoon around the only visible landmark&#x2014;a twelve-year-old boy in slick black waterproof trousers but no hat, alone with a spade. </p><p>It had rained for three days, but the roots of grass and heather and gorse twisting through the soil still resisted the spade&#x2019;s intrusion. Steven&#x2019;s expression did not change; he dug the blade in again, feeling a satisfying little impact all the way up to his armpits. This time he made a mark&#x2014;a thin human mark in the great swathe of nature around him. </p><p>Before Steven could make the next mark, the first narrow stripe had filled with water and disappeared. </p><p>Three boys slouched through the Shipcott rain, their hands deep in their pockets, their hoodies over their faces, their shoulders hunched as if they couldn&#x2019;t wait to get out of the rain. But they had nowhere to hurry to, so they meandered and bumped along and laughed and swore too loudly at nothing at all, just to let the world know they were there and still had expectations. </p><p>The street was narrow and winding and, in summer, passing tourists smiled at the seaside-painted terraces with their doors opening right onto the pavement and their quaint shutters. But the rain made the yellow and pink and sky blue houses a faded reminder of sunshine, and a refuge only for those too young, too old, or too poor to leave. </p><p>Steven&#x2019;s nan looked out of the window with a steady gaze. </p><p>She had started life as Gloria Manners. Then she became Ron Peters&#x2019;s wife. After that, she was Lettie&#x2019;s mum, then Lettie and Billy&#x2019;s mum. Then for a long time she was Poor Mrs. Peters. Now she was Steven&#x2019;s nan. But underneath she would always be Poor Mrs. Peters; nothing could change that, not even her grandsons. </p><p>Above the half-nets, the front window was spotted with rain. The people over the road already had their lights on. The roofs were as different as the walls. Some still wore their old pottery tiles, rough with moss. Others, flat grey slate that reflected the watery sky. Above the roofs, the top of the moor was just visible through the mist&#x2014;a gentle, rounded thing from this distance. From the warmth of a front room with central heating and the kettle starting to whistle in the kitchen, it even looked innocent. </p><p>The shortest of the boys struck the window with the flat of his palm and Steven&#x2019;s nan recoiled in fright. </p><p>The boys laughed and ran although no one was chasing them and they knew no one was likely to. &#x201c;Nosey old bag!&#x201d; one of them shouted back, although it was hard to see which, with their hoods so low on their faces. </p><p>Lettie hurried in, breathless and alarmed. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; </p><p>But Steven&#x2019;s nan was back in the window. She didn&#x2019;t look round at her daughter. &#x201c;Is tea ready?&#x201d; she said. </p><p>Steven walked off the moor with his anorak slung over one shoulder and his T-shirt soaked and steaming with recent effort. The track carved through the heather by generations of walkers was thick with mud. He stopped&#x2014;his rusty spade slung over his other shoulder like a rifle&#x2014;and looked down at the village. The streetlamps were already on and Steven felt like an angel or an alien, observing the darkening dwellings from on high, detached from the tiny lives being lived below. He ducked instinctively as he saw the three hoodies run down the wet road. </p><p>He hid the spade behind a rock near the slippery stile. It was rusty but, still, someone might take it, and he couldn&#x2019;t carry it home with him; that might lead to questions he could not&#x2014;or dared not&#x2014;answer. </p><p>He walked down the narrow passage beside the house. He was cooling now, and shivered as he took off his trainers to run them under the garden tap. They&#x2019;d been white once, with blue flashes. His mum would go mad if she saw them like this. He rubbed them with his thumbs and squeezed the mud out of them until they were only dirty, then shook them hard. Muddy water sprayed up the side of the house, but rain washed it quickly away. His grey school socks were heavy and sodden; he peeled them off, his feet a shocking cold white. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re soaking.&#x201d; His mother peered from the back door, her face pinched and her dark blue eyes as dull as a northern sea. Rain spattered the straw hair that was dragged back into a small, functional ponytail. She jerked her head back inside to keep it dry. </p><p>&#x201c;I got caught in it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;With Lewis.&#x201d; </p><p>This was not strictly a lie. He had been with Lewis immediately after school. </p><p>&#x201c;What were you doing?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. Just. You know.&#x201d; </p><p>From the kitchen he heard his nan say, &#x201c;He should come straight home from school!&#x201d; </p><p>Steven&#x2019;s mother glared at his wetness. &#x201c;Those trainers were only new at Christmas.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, Mum.&#x201d; He looked crestfallen; it often worked. </p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;Tea&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d; </p><p>Steven ate as fast as he dared and as much as he could. Lettie stood at the sink and smoked and dropped her ash down the plughole. At the old house&#x2014;before they came to live with Nan&#x2014;his mum used to sit at the table with him and Davey. She used to eat. She used to talk to him. Now her mouth was always shut tight, even when it held a cigarette. </p><p>Davey sucked the ketchup off his chips then carefully pushed each one to the side of his plate. </p><p>Nan cut little pieces off her breaded fish, inspecting each with a suspicious look before eating it. </p><p>&#x201c;Something wrong with it, Mum?&#x201d; Lettie flicked her ash with undue vigor. Steven looked at her nervously. </p><p>&#x201c;Bones.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a fillet. Says so on the box. Plaice fillet.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They always miss some. You can&#x2019;t be too careful.&#x201d; </p><p>There was a long silence in which Steven listened to the sound of his own food inside his head. </p><p>&#x201c;Eat your chips, Davey.&#x201d; </p><p>Davey screwed up his face. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all wet.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve thought of that before you sucked them, shouldn&#x2019;t you? Shouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p>At the repeated question, Steven stopped chewing, but Nan&#x2019;s fork scraped the plate. </p><p>Lettie moved swiftly to Davey&#x2019;s side and picked up a soggy chip. &#x201c;Eat it!&#x201d; </p><p>Davey shook his head and his lower lip started to wobble. </p><p>With quiet spite, Nan murmured: &#x201c;Leaving food. Kids nowadays don&#x2019;t know they&#x2019;re born.&#x201d; </p><p>Lettie bent down and slapped Davey sharply on the bare thigh below his shorts. Steven watched the white handprint on his brother&#x2019;s skin quickly turn red. He loved Davey, but seeing someone other than himself get into trouble always gave Steven a small thrill, and now&#x2014;watching his mother hustling his brother out of the kitchen and up the stairs, bawling his head off&#x2014;he felt as if he had somehow been accorded an honor: the honor of being spared the pent-up irritation of his mother. God knows, she&#x2019;d taken her feelings for Nan out on him often enough. But this was further proof of what Steven had been hoping for some time&#x2014;that Davey was finally old enough, having just turned five, to suffer his share of the discipline pool. It wasn&#x2019;t a deep pool, or a dangerous one, but what the hell; his mother had a short fuse and a punishment shared was a punishment halved in Steven&#x2019;s eyes. Maybe even a punishment escaped altogether. </p><p>His nan had not stopped eating throughout, although each mouthful was apparently a minefield. </p><p>Even though Davey&#x2019;s sobs were now muffled, Steven sought eye contact with Nan and finally she glanced at him, giving him a chance to roll his eyes, as if the burden of the naughty child was shared and the sharing made them closer. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re no better,&#x201d; she said, and went back to her fish. </p><p>Steven reddened. He knew he was better! If only he could prove it to Nan, everything would be different&#x2014;he just knew it. </p><p>Of course, it was all Billy&#x2019;s fault&#x2014;as usual. </p><p>Steven held his breath. He could hear his mother washing up&#x2014;the underwater clunking of china&#x2014;and his nan drying&#x2014;the higher musical scraping of plates leaving the rack. Then he slowly opened the door of Billy&#x2019;s room. It smelled old and sweet, like an orange left under the bed. Steven felt the door click gently behind him. </p><p>The curtains were drawn&#x2014;always drawn. They matched the bedspread in pale and dark blue squares that clashed with the swirly brown carpet. A half-built Lego space station was on the floor and since Steven&#x2019;s last visit a small spider had spun a web on what looked like a crude docking station. Now it sat there, waiting to capture satellite flies from the outer space of the dingy bedroom. </p><p>There was a drooping scarf pinned to the wall over the bed&#x2014;sky blue and white, Manchester City&#x2014;and Steven felt the familiar pang of pity and anger at Billy: still a loser even in death. </p><p>Steven crept in here sometimes, as if Billy might reach across the years and whisper secrets and solutions into the ear of this nephew who had already lived to see one more birthday than he himself had managed. </p><p>Steven had long ago given up the hope of finding real-life clues. At first he liked to imagine that Uncle Billy might have left some evidence of a precognition of his own death. A <i>Famous Five</i> book dogeared at a key page; the initials &#x201c;AA&#x201d; scratched into the wooden top of the bedside table; Lego scattered to show the points of the compass and X marks the spot. Something which&#x2014;after the event&#x2014;an observant boy might discover and decipher. </p><p>But there was nothing. Just this smell of history and bitter s...</p></p><h2>The Pat Hobby Stories</h2><p>A fascinating study in self-satire that brings to life the Hollywood years of F. Scott Fitzgerald <br> The setting: Hollywood: the character: Pat Hobby, a down-and-out screenwriter trying to break back into show business, but having better luck getting into bars. Written between 1939 and 1940, when F. Scott Fitzgerald was working for Universal Studios, the seventeen Pat Hobby stories were first published in <i>Esquire</i> magazine and present a bitterly humorous portrait of a once-successful writer who becomes a forgotten hack on a Hollywood lot. "This was not art" Pat Hobby often said, "this was an industry" where whom "you sat with at lunch was more important than what you dictated in your office." <br> The Pat Hobby sequence, as Arnold Gingrich writes in his introduction, is Fitzgerald's "last word from his last home, for much of what he felt about Hollywood and about himself permeated these stories."</p><p>F. Scott Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896. He attended Princeton University, joined the United States Army during World War I, and published his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and for the next decade the couple lived in New York, Paris, and on the Riviera. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s novels include <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. He died at the age of forty-four while working on <i>The Last Tycoon</i>. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s fiction has secured his reputation as one of the most important American writers of the 20th century.</p><h2>Hanukcats: and Other Traditional Jewish Songs for Cats</h2><p>You can bet your blintzes that when it comes to the Jewish holidays, cats have just a few things in mind: treats, toys, and mischief.

With the same scholarship and sparkling style that won him admiration as the foremost translator of great works of Japanese literature, Seidensticker offers the reader his brilliant vision of an entire society suddenly wrenched from an ancient feudal past into the modern world in a few short decades, and the enormous stresses and strains that this brought with it. <br><br>Originally published as two volumes, Seidensticker's masterful work is now available in a handy, single paperback volume. Whether you're a history buff or Tokyo-bound traveler looking to learn more, this insightful book offers a fascinating look at how the Tokyo that we know came to be. <br><br>This edition contains an introduction by Donald Richie, the acknowledged expert on Japanese culture who was a close personal friend of the author, and a preface by geographer Paul Waley that puts the book into perspective for modern readers.</p><p><b>Edward Seidensticker</b> (1921-2007) was a distinguished translator and scholar who was responsible for introducing the works of a number of important modern Japanese novelists to the English-speaking world. At the time of the writing of this book, he was spending half of the year in New York where he was Professor of Japanese at Columbia University and half of the year in Tokyo. He is widely known for his translation of <i>The Tale of Genji</i>, which he described as "a labor of love"&#x2014;it took almost 10 years to complete. He also wrote several nonfiction books about Japan and was awarded a National Book Award for his translation of <i>The Sound of the Mountain</i> in 1971. <br><br><b>Donald Richie</b> (1924-2013) spent nearly sixty years witnessing and reporting on the transformation of Japan from its postwar devastation to a twenty-first century economic and cultural powerhouse. <br><br> <b>Paul Waley</b> is a geographer at the University of Leeds. He has written several books on Tokyo's history, social development, and its changing dynamics in contemporary Japan."There can be few cities in the world that live, pulsate, and breathe through their geography as Tokyo does, few cities with a history that shifts through the creases of space as does that of Tokyo. This is particularly ironic in a city whose neighborhoods today hold few distinctive features and whose gentle topography has been all but obscured by batteries of building. But it was not always so, and what better way is there of writing Tokyo's history than by reflecting this shifting geography as neighborhoods prospered and declined while others, more aspirational, climbed up the socio-spacial ladder? This is precisely what Edward Seidensticker does in the pages of [this book]." <b>&#x2014;<i>Books on Asia</i></b></p><h2>Keeping the Peace: Mindfulness and Public Service</h2><p><i>Keeping the Peace<i>speaks to all of us who work in difficult, people-oriented jobs and shows us how to turn environments that are often filled with anger, stress, and frustration into islands of peace. Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh creates a revolutionary definition of public service that includes all of us. He challenges us to transform the way we think about our work and offers eleven key practices to strengthen our mindfulness and joy.<br><br>Based on a retreat for civil servants, <i>Keeping the Peace</i> is the first book of its kind to demonstrate the usefulness of mindfulness practices for law enforcement officers, social workers, teachers, and others in people-helping professions. <br><br>With empathy and humor, Thich Nhat Hanh demonstrates the need for public service professionals to cultivate their own inner peace in order to help others. In clear and simple prose, he offers a path for how we can reduce violence in ourselves, our workplace, and ultimately, in our world.</i></i></p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today. His best-selling books include <i>Happiness</i> and <i>Peace Is Every Step</i>. He lives in Plum Village in southwest France, where he teaches the art of mindful living.A police officer is someone who is supposed to bring peace. Your duty is to maintain peace. Peace means the absence of conflict, violence, and anger. You should have peace within yourself in order to truly be doing the work of peace. Making peace is not possible without being peace. And being peace is your practice. Recognize the violence, the fear and anger in you, embrace them and transform them. Getting in touch with the wonderful, healing, and nourishing things around and inside you for your nourishment and the nourishment of your family and community. That should be your daily practice. Thich Nhat Hahn in Keeping the Peace 2) If you practice law enforcement based on your anger, on your violence, using only your authority to suppress your children and others, that kind of practice will not bring peace, will not bring happiness and harmony at all&#x2019;&#x2019;When we speak of law enforcement, using a police force, a huge administration to take care of detentions and prisons&#x2019;we try to suppress violence as symptoms. But at the same time we allow violence to be fed into our daily life&#x2019;into our family, our schools, our society. It does not mean much to try to suppress the symptoms. You have to deal with the roots. Suppressing violence with violence does not make any sense. Because the person in charge of suppressing violence may have a lot of violence and fear and despair within himself or herself. Thich Nhat Hahn in Keeping the Peace We&#x2019;re not called police officers, we&#x2019;re called peace officers. I don&#x2019;t know how many of you knew that, but we are peace officers in the statutes. We are peace officers. Our job is to strengthen relationships in the community and to help you strengthen relationships in the community, to improve the safety net that needs to be there for all of us to have a chance. Sheri Maples &#x2018; from the Introduction The officers have never had any exposure to chasing cucumbers around on our plates in silence, or walking mindfully, or to hugging meditation, which was really fun. One of the things that is very important for us to have you believe that this can happen in the police departments in your communities. Sheri Maples &#x2018; from the Introduction As police officers we are extremely familiar with the suffering, the intense suffering that is caused by killing and poverty and exploitation and social injustice, stealing, sexual abuse, unmindful consumption and oppression.

In this last category, tanks had grown in size, weight, and firepower to counter ever-improving anti-tank weapon systems. This resulted in changes in tactics and doctrine to better integrate heavy armor into a combined arms system. This was especially true on the Eastern Front, where the open terrain promoted armor action and a rapid cycle of improvements. The Soviets were quick to develop vehicles that were able to fight the Tiger I on an equal footing by late 1943, such as the up-gunned T-34/85 and the self-propelled ISU-152s. Because the American T-26/M-26 Pershing arrived late in the war, and the British Centurion not at all, only the Soviet IS-2 serves as an example of a heavy design that was fielded in large battlefield numbers. The Soviet drive to cut off enemy forces in East Prussia during Operation Solstice (February 1945) is a prime example of this conflict. The Germans, had limited resources, and were strategically on the defensive, but enjoyed ever-shorter logistic distances as they retreated, and fought in an environment and terrain that played to the strengths of the technically-superior King Tiger. The IS-2 was lighter, more maneuverable, and far more numerous, and used these assets to its advantage. This battle, fought in the closing months of the war, depicts the classic late-war contrast between the military doctrines of Germany and the Soviet Union.</p><p>David R.

Escaping gray London in 1972, a beautiful, determined mother takes her daughters, aged 5 and 7, to Morocco in search of adventure, a better life, and maybe love. <em>Hideous Kinky</em> follows two little English girls -- the five-year-old narrator and Bea, her seven-year-old sister -- as they struggle to establish some semblance of normal life on a trip to Morocco with their hippie mother, Julia. Once in Marrakech, Julia immerses herself in Sufism and her quest for personal fulfillment, while her daughters rebel -- the older by trying to recreate her English life, the younger by turning her hopes for a father on a most unlikely candidate. </p><p>Shocking and wonderful, <em>Hideous Kinky</em> is at once melancholy and hopeful. A remarkable debut novel from one of England's finest young writers, <em>Hideous Kinky</em> was inspired by the author's own experiences as a child. Esther Freud, daughter of the artist Lucian Freud and great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, lived in Marrakech for one and a half years with her older sister Bella and her mother. <em>Hideous Kinky</em> is now a major motion picture starring Kate Winslet ("Titanic," "Sense and Sensibility").</p></p><p><i>Hideous Kinky</i> begins as a small, cheerful autobiographical novel following Thurber's variation on Wordsworth: "Humor is emotional chaos recollected in tranquillity." In the mid-1960s, two girls, ages 5 and 7, travel with their mother from London to Marrakech. Also along for the ride are John, Mum's boyfriend, and Maretta, John's wife. Though the author is a descendant of Sigmund Freud, the title of her first book has little to do with the pleasure principle. Instead, it is the only phrase the sisters have heard Maretta speak, one that quickly becomes an all-purpose epithet: "One of the shepherds whistled and the dogs slung to the ground. Bea raised an eyebrow as she passed me. 'Hideous kinky,' she whispered." Esther Freud's vocabulary and tone veer easily from the childlike to the more sophisticated, particularly when she recounts speech or circumstances beyond a child's comprehension. <p> Once the group arrives in Marrakech, John and Maretta split off, and Mum hooks up with various men and pursues spirituality. The children, meanwhile, want nothing more than to be normal--or at least not to be so embarrassed by their mother's Islamic fervor: "'Oh Mum, please...' I was prepared to beg. 'Please don't be a Sufi.'" In <i>Hideous Kinky</i>, people appear and disappear with little reason or explanation. Though most of the characters are differentiated by one outstanding feature, Bilal, the itinerant builder and magician's apprentice who becomes one of Mum's lovers, is more complex. The narrator loves and trusts him from the start, and when she asks him if he will eventually return to England with them, "Bilal closed his eyes and began to hum along with Om Kalsoum, whose voice crackled and wept through a radio in the back of the caf�." </p><p> <i>Hideous Kinky</i> is curiously divided. The first half is a lark. The girls explore Marrakech, picking up the language and even passing themselves off as beggars. The family's only worries are about money, and these are soon cured by the next bank draft from their father. But the second half is more melancholy. Mum's religious zeal becomes rather less endearing, and as the girls' adventures turn more dangerous, local rituals and customs begin to lose their charm: "I didn't like to think about the camel festival. The camel, garlanded in flowers, collected us from our house in the Mellah, and we had followed it out of the city and high into the mountains in a procession of singing." The parade ends, however, with the animal's beheading. "Occasionally I looked at Bea to see if she was running over these events like I was, the sound effects living their own life behind her eyes, but she gave nothing away." </p><p> In the end, <i>Hideous Kinky</i> is a novel less about an exotic country seen through an innocent's eyes than about family, about having a deeply embarrassing mother, an older sister who does everything before you, and a distant father. It escapes sentimentality through simplicity: "Bilal was my Dad. No one denied it when I said so." The author, her sister, and her mother spent two years in Morocco, and while Esther Freud may not have invented her subject, she has re-created it with a light touch and delicate irony.</p><p>Esther Freud is the great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud and the daughter of the painter Lucian Freud. She trained as an actress before writing her first novel. Her books have been translated into thirteen languages. She lives in London.</p></p><h2>CIA Lock Picking: Field Operative Training Manual</h2><p>Did you ever lose your keys? Lock picking is the skill of unlocking a lock by analyzing and manipulating the components of the lock device, without the original key. Although lock picking can be associated with criminal intent, it is an essential skill for a locksmith. Lock picking is the ideal way of opening a lock without the correct key, while not damaging the lock, allowing it to be rekeyed for later use, which is especially important with antique locks that would be impossible to replace if destructive entry methods were used.</p><p>The <strong>Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</strong>, is an independent agency responsible for providing national security intelligence to senior US policymakers.

They are located in Langley, Virginia.</p><h2>Milosz: A Biography</h2><p><p>Andrzej Franaszek&#x2019;s award-winning biography of Czeslaw Milosz&#x2015;the great Polish poet and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980&#x2015;offers a rich portrait of the writer and his troubled century, providing context for a larger appreciation of his work. This English-language edition, translated by Aleksandra Parker and Michael Parker, contains a new introduction by the translators, along with historical explanations, maps, and a chronology.</p><p>Franaszek recounts the poet&#x2019;s personal odyssey through the events that convulsed twentieth-century Europe: World War I, the Bolshevik revolution, the Nazi invasion and occupation of Poland, and the Soviet Union&#x2019;s postwar dominance of Eastern Europe. He follows the footsteps of a perpetual outsider who spent much of his unsettled life in Lithuania, Poland, and France, where he sought political asylum. From 1960 to 1999, Milosz lived in the United States before returning to Poland, where he died in 2004.</p><p>Franaszek traces Milosz&#x2019;s changing, constantly questioning, often skeptical attitude toward organized religion. In the long term, he concluded that faith performed a positive role, not least as an antidote to the amoral, soulless materialism that afflicts contemporary civilization. Despite years of hardship, alienation, and neglect, Milosz retained a belief in the transformative power of poetry, particularly its capacity to serve as a source of moral resistance and a reservoir of collective hope. Seamus Heaney once said that Milosz&#x2019;s poetry is irradiated by wisdom. <i>Milosz</i> reveals how that wisdom was tempered by experience even as the poet retained a childlike wonder in a misbegotten world.</p></p><p><p>Andrzej Franaszek is Assistant Professor of Polish Literature at Krakow's Pedagogical University.</p><p>Aleksandra Parker is a translator and international communications adviser.</p><p>Michael Parker is Visiting Professor in English Literature, Oxford Brookes University, and a writer and lecturer.</p>&#x201c;Czeslaw Milosz was one of the great poets of the twentieth century. He lived through many of its terrors, its spiritual agonies, and the fierce intellectual combat about its meaning, and there is something heroic about the intensity of his desire to name what he saw and make sense of it. Andrzej Franaszek has mastered Milosz&#x2019;s wide-ranging poetry and prose and deployed them to create a vivid, richly textured portrait of the man, his art and his era. For anyone who wants to understand Milosz&#x2019;s work, perhaps for anyone who wants to understand the European twentieth century and its terrible violence, this is an essential book and it is a spellbinding read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Hass</b><br><br>&#x201c;Franaszek&#x2019;s outstanding biography of Czeslaw Milosz narrates one of the great lives of the twentieth century, and does not shy away from recounting the more private side of the poet&#x2019;s loves, moods, victories, and defeats. Milosz was an artist who was also a political thinker, who stood in the center of the ideological debates of his time, who was an incredibly industrious writer and on top of all this had a sublime gift for poetry. One of the finest literary critics of his generation in Poland, Franaszek is well suited to his subject. A triumph.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Zagajewski</b><br><br>&#x201c;It took Franaszek ten years to compose this life of Mi&#x142;osz, and Aleksandra and Michael Parker another six to translate it. The result is a classic of the genre: a biography based on interviews and exhaustive documentary research. It is tolerant, perceptive, beautifully written and utterly objective. It is also an effective critical study, containing generous excerpts of Mi&#x142;osz&#x2019;s writing that make it almost an anthology of his poetry and essays...

Add the onion and saut� until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and bay leaves and saut� just until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and stir until evenly coated. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is slightly toasted and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes. Pour in 1 cup of the stock to deglaze the pan, using a wooden spoon to scrape up all the stubborn, tasty brown bits. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups of stock and the cranberries. Bring to a boil, then immediately lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and some of the grains have popped, 50 to 60 minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and drain off any excess liquid.</p> <p> While the rice is cooking, prepare the brussels sprouts. Preheat the oven to 375�F. In a large bowl, combine the maple syrup, oil, Sriracha, liquid aminos, and lime juice and whisk until well blended. Add the Brussels sprouts and toss until evenly coated. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the Brussels sprouts to a nonstick or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet or a large cast-iron skillet and spread them in a single layer. Reserve any liquid left in the bowl. Bake the brussels sprouts for about 25 minutes, until tender and browned. </p> <p> To finish the rice and serve, add the walnuts to the rice without stirring. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Add the rosemary and fluff with a fork to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the brussels sprouts over the rice, garnished with a healthy drizzle of the reserved maple- Sriracha dressing and a sprinkling of parsley.</p> <p> You can use honey in place of the maple syrup if you wish. Raw orange blossom honey would be especially nice.</p> <p><b>Featured Recipe from <i>The Veggie-Lover&#x2019;s Sriracha Cookbook</i>: Ultimate Sriracha Veggie Burger</b></p> <p> Remove any preconceived notions you may have about veggie burgers.

Filled with her delicious humor and warmth, the twenty-two stories in <b>London Transports</b> will delight and captivate as they take us to a place that is far away&#x2014;and yet so familiar...Where having an affair with a married man brings one woman to a turning point...Where another finds that looking for an apartment to share can be a risky business...Where nosing into a secretary's life can have shocking results...Where a dress designer just had a god-awful day...And where Maeve Binchy captures the beat of every woman's heart.</p><p>Maeve Binchy was born and educated in Dublin. She is the bestselling author of <b>The Return Journey, Evening Class, This Year It Will Be Different,</b> and <b>The Glass Lakes</b>. She has written two plays and a teleplay that won three awards at the Prague Film Festival. She has been writing for The Irish Times since 1969 and lives with her husband, writer and broadcaster Gordon Snell, in Dublin.<b>Shepherd's Bush</b><br><br>People looked very weary, May thought, and shabbier than she had remembered Londoners to be. They reminded her a little of those news-reel pictures of crowds during the war or just after it, old raincoats, brave smiles, endless patience. But then this wasn't Regent Street, where she had wandered up and down looking at shops on other visits to London, it wasn't the West End, with lights all glittering and people getting out of taxis full of excitement and wafts of perfume. This was Shepherd's Bush, where people lived. They had probably set out from here early this morning and fought similar crowds on the way to work. The women must have done their shopping in their lunch hour because most of them were carrying plastic bags of food. It was a London different to the one you see as a tourist.<br><br>And she was here for a different reason, although she had once read a cynical article in a magazine which said that girls coming to London for abortions provided a significant part of the city's tourist revenue. It wasn't something you could classify under any terms as a holiday. When she filled in the card at the airport she had written "Business" in the section where it said "Purpose of journey."<br><br>The pub where she was to meet Celia was near the tube station. She found it easily and settled herself in. A lot of the accents were Irish, workmen having a pint before they went home to their English wives and their television programmes. Not drunk tonight, it was only Monday, but obviously regulars. Maybe not so welcome as regulars on Friday or Saturday nights, when they would remember they were Irish and sing anti-British songs.<br><br>Celia wouldn't agree with her about that. Celia had rose-tinted views about the Irish in London, she thought they were all here from choice, not because there was no work for them at home. She hated stories about the restless Irish, or Irishmen on the lump in the building trade. She said people shouldn't make such a big thing about it all. People who came from much farther away settled in London, it was big enough to absorb everyone. Oh well, she wouldn't bring up the subject, there were enough things to disagree with Celia about . . . without searching for more.<br><br>Oh why of all people, of all the bloody people in the world, did she have to come to Celia? Why was there nobody else whom she could ask for advice? Celia would give it, she would give a lecture with every piece of information she imparted. She would deliver a speech with every cup of tea, she would be cool, practical, and exactly the right person, if she weren't so much the wrong person. It was handing Celia a whole box of ammunition about Andy. From now on Celia could say that Andy was a rat, and May could no longer say she had no facts to go on.<br><br>Celia arrived. She was thinner, and looked a little tired. She smiled. Obviously the lectures weren't going to come in the pub. Celia always knew the right place for things. Pubs were for meaningless chats and bright, nonintense conversation. Home was for lectures.<br><br>"You're looking marvellous," Celia said.<br><br>It couldn't be true. May looked at her reflection in a glass panel. You couldn't see the dark lines under her eyes there, but you could see the droop of her shoulders, she wasn't a person that could be described as looking marvellous. No, not even in a pub.<br><br>"I'm okay," she said. "But you've got very slim, how did you do it?"<br><br>"No bread, no cakes, no potatoes, no sweets," said Celia in a businesslike way. "It's the old rule but it's the only rule. You deny yourself everything you want and you lose weight."<br><br>"I know," said May, absently rubbing her waistline.<br><br>"Oh I didn't mean <i>that,"</i> cried Celia, horrified. "I didn't mean that at all."<br><br>May felt weary, she hadn't meant that either, she was patting her stomach because she had been putting on weight. The child that she was going to get rid of was still only a speck, it would cause no bulge. She had put on weight because she cooked for Andy three or four times a week in his flat. He was long and lean. He could eat forever and he wouldn't put on weight. He didn't like eating alone so she ate with him. She reassured Celia that there was no offence and when Celia had gone, twittering with rage at herself, to the counter, May wondered whether she had explored every avenue before coming to Celia and Shepherd's Bush for help.<br><br>She had. There were no legal abortions in Dublin, and she did not know of anyone who had ever had an illegal one there. England and the ease of the system were less than an hour away by plane. She didn't want to try and get it on the National Health, she had the money, all she wanted was someone who would introduce her to a doctor, so that she could get it all over with quickly. She needed somebody who knew her, somebody who wouldn't abandon her if things went wrong, somebody who would lie for her, because a few lies would have to be told. May didn't have any other friends in London. There was a girl she had once met on a skiing holiday, but you couldn't impose on a holiday friendship in that way. She knew a man, a very nice, kind man who had stayed in the hotel where she worked and had often begged her to come and stay with him and his wife. But she couldn't go to stay with them for the first time in this predicament, it would be ridiculous. It had to be Celia.<br><br>It might be easier if Celia had loved somebody so much that everything else was unimportant. But stop, that wasn't fair. Celia loved that dreary, boring, selfish Martin. She loved him so much that she believed one day he was going to get things organized and make a home for them. Everyone else knew that Martin was the worst possible bet for any punter, a Mamma's boy who had everything he wanted now, including a visit every two months from Celia, home from London, smartly dressed, undemanding, saving away for a day that would never come. So Celia did understand something about the nature of love. She never talked about it. People as brisk as Celia don't talk about things like unbrisk attitudes in men, or hurt feelings or broken hearts. Not when it refers to themselves, but they are very good at pointing out the foolish attitudes of others.<br><br>Celia was back with the drinks.<br><br>"We'll finish them up quickly," she said.<br><br>Why could she never, never take her ease over anything? Things always had to be finished up quickly. It was warm and anonymous in the pub. They could go back to Celia's flat, which May felt sure wouldn't have even a comfortable chair in it, and talk in a businesslike way about the rights and wrongs of abortion, the procedure, the money, and how it shouldn't be spent on something so hopeless and destructive. And about Andy. Why wouldn't May tell him? He had a right to know. The child was half his, and even if he didn't want it he should pay for the abortion. He had plenty of money, he was a hotel manager. May had hardly any, she was a hotel receptionist. May could see it all coming, she dreaded it. She wanted to stay in this warm place until closing time, and to fall asleep, and wake up there two days later.<br><br>Celia made walking-along-the-road conversation on the way to her flat. This road used to be very quiet and full of retired people, now it was all flats and bed-sitters. That road was nice, but noisy, too much through traffic. The houses in the road over there were going for thirty-five thousand, which was ridiculous, but then you had to remember it was fairly central and they did have little gardens. Finally they were there. A big Victorian house, a clean, polished hall, and three flights of stairs. The flat was much bigger than May expected, and it had a sort of divan on which she sat down immediately and put up her legs while Celia fussed about a bit, opening a bottle of wine and putting a dish of four small lamb chops into the oven. May braced herself for the lecture.<br><br>It wasn't a lecture, it was an information sheet. She was so relieved that she could feel herself relaxing, and filled up her wineglass again.<br><br>"I've arranged with Dr. Harris that you can call to see him tomorrow morning at eleven. I told him no lies, just a little less than the truth. I said you were staying with me. If he thinks that means you are staying permanently, that's his mistake not mine. I mentioned that your problem was . . . what it is. I asked him when he thought it would be . . . em . . . done. He said Wednesday or Thursday, but it would all depend. He didn't seem shocked or anything; it's like tonsillitis to him, I suppose. Anyway he was very calm about it. I think you'll find he's a kind person and it won't be upsetting . . . that part of it."<br><br>May was dumbfounded. Where were the accusations, the I-told-you-so sighs, the hope that now, finally, she would finish with Andy? Where was the slight moralistic bit, the heavy wondering whether or not it might be murder? For the first time in the eleven days since she had confirmed she was pregnant, May began to hope that there would be some normality in the world again.<br><br>"Will it embarrass you, all this?" she asked. "I mean, do you feel it will change your relationship with him?"<br><br>"In London a doctor isn't an old family friend like at home, May. He's someone you go to, or I've gone to anyway, when I've had to have my ears syringed, needed antibiotics for flu last year, and a medical certificate for the time I sprained my ankle and couldn't go to work. He hardly knows me except as a name on his register. He's nice though, and he doesn't rush you in and out. He's Jewish and small and worried-looking."<br><br>Celia moved around the flat, changing into comfortable sitting-about clothes, looking up what was on television, explaining to May that she must sleep in her room and that she, Celia, would use the divan.<br><br>No, honestly, it would be easier that way, she wasn't being nice, it would be much easier. A girl friend rang and they arranged to play squash together at the week-end. A wrong number rang; a West Indian from the flat downstairs knocked on the door to say he would be having a party on Saturday night and to apologize in advance for any noise. If they liked to bring a bottle of something, they could call in themselves. Celia served dinner. They looked at television for an hour, then went to bed.<br><br>May thought what a strange empty life Celia led here far from home, miles from Martin, no real friends, no life at all. Then she thought that Celia might possibly regard her life too as sad, working in a second-rate hotel for five years, having an affair with its manager for three years. A hopeless affair because the manager's wife and four children were a bigger stumbling block than Martin's mother could ever be. She felt tired and comfortable, and in Celia's funny, characterless bedroom she drifted off and dreamed that Andy had discovered where she was and what she was about to do, and had flown over during the night to tell her that they would get married next morning, and live in England and forget the hotel, the family, and what anyone would say.<br><br>Tuesday morning, Celia was gone. Dr. Harris's address was neatly written on the pad by the phone with instructions how to get there. Also Celia's phone number at work, and a message that May never believed she would hear from Celia. "Good luck."<br><br>He was small, and Jewish, and worried, and kind. His examination was painless and unembarrassing. He confirmed what she knew already. He wrote down dates, and asked general questions about her health. May wondered whether he had a family, there were no pictures of wife or children in the surgery. But then there were none in Andy's office, either. Perhaps his wife was called Rebecca and she, too, worried because her husband worked so hard, they might have two children, a boy who was a gifted musician, and a girl who wanted to get married to a Christian. Maybe they all walked along these leafy roads on Saturdays to synagogue and Rebecca cooked all those things like gefilte fish and bagels.<br><br>With a start, May told herself to stop dreaming about him. It was a habit she had gotten into recently, fancying lives for everyone she met, however briefly. She usually gave them happy lives with a bit of problem-to-be-solved thrown in. She wondered what a psychiatrist would make of that. As she was coming back to real life, Dr. Harris was saying that if he was going to refer her for a termination he must know why she could not have the baby. He pointed out that she was healthy, and strong, and young. She should have no difficulty with pregnancy or birth. Were there emotional reasons? Yes, it would kill her parents, she wouldn't be able to look after the baby, she didn't want to look after one on her own either, it wouldn't be fair on her or the baby.<br><br>"And the father?" Dr. Harris asked.<br><br>"Is my boss, is heavily married, already has four babies of his own. It would break up his marriage, which he doesn't want to do . . . yet. No, the father wouldn't want me to have it either."<br><br>"Has he said that?" asked Dr. Harris as if he already knew the answer.<br><br>"I haven't told him, I can't tell him, I won't tell him," said May.<br><br>Dr. Harris sighed. He asked a few more questions; he made a telephone call; he wrote out an address. It was a posh address near Harley Street.<br><br>"This is Mr. White. A well-known surgeon. These are his consulting rooms, I have made an appointment for you at two-thirty this afternoon. I understand from your friend Miss . . ." He searched his mind and his desk for Celia's name and then gave up. "I understand anyway that you are not living here, and don't want to try and pretend that you are, so that you want the termination done privately. That's just as well, because it would be difficult to get it done on the National Health. There are many cases that would have to come before you."<br><br>"Oh I have the money," said May, patting her handbag. She felt nervous but relieved at the same time. Almost exhilarated. It was working, the whole thing was actually moving. God bless Celia.<br><br>"It will be around �180 to �200, and in cash, you know that?"<br><br>"Yes, it's all here, but why should a well-known surgeon have to be paid in cash, Dr. Harris? You know it makes it look a bit illegal and sort of underhand, doesn't it?"<br><br>Dr. Harris smiled a tired smile. "You ask me why he has to be paid in cash. Because he says so. Why he says so, I don't know. Maybe it's because some of his clients don't feel too like paying him after the event. It's not like plastic surgery or a broken leg, where they can see the results. In a termination you see no results. Maybe people don't pay so easily then. Maybe also Mr. White doesn't have a warm relationship with his income tax people. I don't know."<br><br>"Do I owe you anything?" May asked, putting on her coat.<br><br>"No, my dear, nothing." He smiled and showed her to the door.<br><br>"It feels wrong. I'm used to paying a doctor at home or they send bills," she said.<br><br>"Send me a picture postcard of your nice country sometime," he said. "When my wife was alive she and I spent several happy holidays there before all this business started." He waved a hand to take in the course of Anglo-Irish politics and difficulties over the last ten years.<br><br>May blinked a bit hard and thanked him. She took a taxi which was passing his door and went to Oxford Street. She wanted to see what was in the shops because she was going to pretend that she had spent �200 on clothes and then they had all been lost or stolen. She hadn't yet worked out the details of this deception, which seemed unimportant compared to all the rest that had to be gone through. But she would need to know what was in the shops so that she could say what she was meant to have bought.<br><br>Imagin...</p><h2>Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China</h2><p>The author of The Soong Dynasty gives us our most vivid and reliable biography yet of the Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, remembered through the exaggeration and falsehood of legend as the ruthless Manchu concubine who seduced and murdered her way to the Chinese throne in 1861.</p><p>"An all-out revisionist assault on the established perception of Tzu Hsi...Seagrave provides as sad and outrageous a record of imperialism as can be found anywhere in the world."<br>--The San Francisco Chronicle<b>Sterling Seagrave</b> grew up in Asia on the Burma&#x2013;China border.

Not sure who she can trust,Quinn flees her controlling employers and sets out to discover who shereally is, uncovering far more than she could imagine. Quinn is asympathetic character, and readers will want her and fellowcloser-on-the-run Deacon to succeed in their mission and theirrelationship. Young's latest book perfectly illustrates how goodintentions can lead to horrible results. An effort to save people frompain and grief actually causes much more damage than simply lettingpeople feel hurt. <i>The Epidemic</i> is the sequel to <i>The Remedy </i>(Simon Pulse, 2015/<i>Voya</i> April 2015), and both novels serve as companion books that lead to the events in Young's popular <i>Program</i> duology. Although this new duology can stand on its own, teens who have read <i>The Program</i> (Simon Pulse, 2013/<i>Voya</i> April 2013) and <i>The Treatment </i>(Simon Pulse, 2014/<i>Voya</i> June 2014) already will finish <i>The Epidemic</i> with a deeper understanding of how and why society could wind up like it does. Readers who have not read the <i>Program</i> duology yet will be interested enough to continue with Young's unique dystopian world.

The unforgettable portrait of Max, the Paris drifter, and the probably-autobiographical <em>Tailor Shop</em>, are basically short stories, but even here the irrepressible vitality of Miller&#x2019;s personality keeps breaking into the narrative. And in the critical and philosophical essays, the prose poems and surrealist fantasies, the travel sketches and scenarios, Miller&#x2019;s passion for fiction, for telling the endless story of his extraordinary life, cannot be held down. Life, as no other modern author has lived it or can write it, bursts from these pages&#x2015;the life of the mind and the body; of people, places and things; of ideas and the imagination.</p><p>This collection, first published by New Directions in 1939, contains a number of Henry Miller&#39;s most important shorter prose writings.
